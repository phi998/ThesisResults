I was wondering how people in 1895 were feeling when they saw the steam rise from the barrels of water. Did they subconsciously feel the heat, while sitting in the theater. This is probably the first time they ever saw images up on a screen or wall. Who knows what they thought. They may have even thought of it, as being a parlor trick.

Today the gag is so old it doesn't work at all and thus the main reason to watch this short is because of the historical significance.
 
However, I have something to say about this significance. Yes, this is considered the first comedy by many. And I'm not denying how important it is in cinematic history. But the truth is, this is not the first filmed comedy ever made. One year before, the Edison Manufacturing Company had performers Phil Doretto and Robetta star in several kinetoscope films of their comedy routine. The one surviving film of these three shorts is 'Chinese Laundry Scene' which was filmed in Edison's 'Black Maria' studio and while simply a filming of this routine, THAT short can be considered the first comedy. This one remains important as ONE of the first comedies, but not as THE first comedies.",3.0,Tornado_Sam,"Oct 15, 2017",1896 (Finland),Tables Turned on the Gardener,By what name was The Waterer Watered (1895) officially released in Canada in English?

I didn't watch all of them as the main problem with these type of things that their value is more in their historical novelty value rather than entertainment. So to watch them you do need to be put in the correct context so that you can keep this in mind and not watch it with modern eyes. With the Primitives & Pioneers DVD collection though you get nothing to help you out, literally the films are played one after the other (the main menu option is 'play all') for several hours. With this it is hard to understand their relevance and as an educational tool it falls down as it leaves the viewer to fend for themselves, which I'm sure is fine for some viewers but certainly not the majority. What it means is that the DVD saves you searching the web for the films individually by putting them all in one place  but that's about it.",3.0,bob the moo,"Feb 27, 2008",1895 (France),Човен виходить із порту,By what name was Boat Leaving the Port (1895) officially released in Canada in English?
