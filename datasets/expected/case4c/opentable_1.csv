The steak Florence was superb, the staff clearly busy (place sold out) was kind and gracious to the only solo table there that night.   Yes I felt awkward and self conscious but not the establishment fault.  It will be awhile before I dine out alone again but glad my first time was at Pariones.

Even though they are open..they want you to
Come later, they want you to wait, beg even? Don’t know but we tired of always having to wait ..then the restaurant filling and service slow. We are repeat diners at most of our favorite places .. parione is lovely. Prefer downstairs ..bisteca great, apps great. Didn’t like the up selling on every wine, every course. I don’t need to be over fed abs I know what I like.                     Is this helpful?

The wait staff was inexperienced, overwhelmed, and not happy about it. We felt ignored as tourists and forgotten in the back by the bathroom. To be fair, the food was very good, but hard to enjoy when the experience was so poor. To top it off, the 'New Years Menu' was the everyday menu we were expecting, but the prices were more than doubled. Had we known this in advance, we would not have eaten there. We should've listened to our taxi driver on the way over who said, 'It's not a restaurant, but a bank.'                     Is this helpful?

The waiters were underwhelming to say the least and my family felt that we were definitely not the point of emphasis during this experience. Some suggestions: take pride not only in your food, but in your quality of service. Act as if your customers matter (because they do) rather than what you’re focusing on now. I appreciate the experience overall and was satisfied with the food (not blown away but satisfactory). Given the popularity and reputation of this restaurant we were very disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant as it gave the feeling of a tourist trap rather than an authentic Florentine experience.

My daughter is celiac and normally struggles to find places who provide a gluten free option. She need not have worried about that here. The selection was vast and the quality of food was not compromised - it was fantastic.

The staff went to great lengths to explain that there was a totally separate kitchen to prepare gluten free food. This makes such a difference to those who suffer from celiac disease.

The wine, food, atmosphere was brilliant. Above all else, the staff were so so good!

I cannot recommend this place enough. Thank you Ciro & Sons.                     Is this helpful?

What a waste of an entire night. We had a 7pm reservation but we showed up at 6:45pm. We were sat immediately so I was very pleased with that. It all went to crap after that.

We (and the couple next to us) both literally waited 30 minutes for a waiter to even come up to us after sitting down. No water, no bread, nothing. Absolutely insane to me. Eventually we were allowed to place our drink and orders for an app, and 2 pizzas. We got calamari and 2 pizzas that I forget the name of. This was around 730pm now.

Literally the calamari took 1 entire hour to get. The photo I’ve attached is 8:08pm. We had only bread, our drinks, and water on our table at this point. So we finally get the calamari about 830pm and then we finished that in 5-7 minutes. Then the pizzas took another 25 minutes and my pizza was wrong. They made me a new one, a margarita pizza, which didn’t cost the same as the speciality pizza I ordered but I didn’t even care at this point. The food was all subpar as well. Overhyped to say the least.

If you’re into tight quarter dining, fast pace atmosphere, chaoticness, and lack of attention or care from your waiter and want to spend your entire evening here instead of wondering the Florence streets, this is the place for you. I’d rather eat elsewhere than this marathon dining experience                     Is this helpful?

It's actually nice they have photo and translated menus (and I understand it's a good place for gluten free people), but this top rated joint is NOT proper Florentine quality, which is a shame because the expectation is that a long-standing family-owned venue would cherish quality forever.  What we have instead are wobbly outdoor tables, rickety folding chairs, waiters that ask for your order after it had already been taken by another, long wait times, and underwhelming food.  I'm not sure if the Famiglia is actually long gone then and this place is just a franchise for a failing corporate brand run by people who don't know the difference between true Florentine food that sings an aria to your soul and just following a recipe.  Maybe all the tourists who gave this place 5 stars can't tell the difference either.                                    Is this helpful?

Food was ok, not great for the price, and service was subpar. If you are looking for a nice restaurant with characteristics of Milan, this is not the place. It’s a hotel bar at the end of the day. Roof top view is nice, but not the focal point. Ambiance also is fine for a drink, but layout resembles more of a lounge than a restaurant. Granted this is the bar, we were unable to reserve the actual restaurant since it wasn’t open. However, I wouldn’t recommend.                                    Is this helpful?

I do understand if they were too busy, but they shouldn't have availability then on Open Table.  The hostess was so rude and handled the situation so badly.  I think as a service establishment they should try and teach their staff to treat customers better.  Kindness goes a long way and I don't care how special their establishment is.  I'm still a paying customer at the end of the day.

The food was okay - I was expecting grated truffle on the fries and not a little truffle oil. No bread with the tartare, even after asking twice. The fillet was well instead of medium. Music was good and the people were nice.              STK Milan   Responded on January 2, 2024    Thank you Valdrim H, we appreciate your rating and the 4 start you left us! We’re glad to hear you had a positive experience overall. We appreciate your feedvback regarding the fries, but unfortunatly it is too hard to grate some truffle on it so we opted for a truffled oli that stays on the fries and mixes well with the parmesan. 
I really apologize for the bread, i think we really slipped there! so sorry!
we hope you can come visit us again, so we can make it up to you.

Best regards and happy new year!

I am an American traveling in Italy for a few months and was craving a steak dinner. STK did not disappoint. Upon climbing the spiral staircase, diners are greeted by a dinning room that is contemporary and sexy yet sophisticated. Everyone from the hostess to the servers provided excellent service and provided great recommendations for dishes. I started off with the calamari fritti which provided a nice balance between the fish and fried batter. My server’s suggestion of the sliced filet medallion satisfied my yearning for a steak and was paired with a potato cake and a bold au poivre sauce. I will be back next time I am in Milan to try some of their other offerings on the menu.

I booked about two weeks before for my husbands birthday. When we arrived they greater us warmly and we received our food quickly. The food was good. For the price, I would would not consider it spectacular. I have had much better for cheaper and for equally price food. After eating our food there were  3 other tables who the staff came and sang happy birthday to. Upon waiting fifteen minutes for our waiter to check on us, offer dessert, a check or a happy birthday surprise I finally asked for the check. Five minutes later the waiter comes with a cake. Replies oh and happy birthday and gives us the check. No other staff members came over to sing and we even had to flag our waiter down for silverware to eat the cake. Highly disappointed that myself and my daughter has to sing happy birthday to my husband. Despite the fact that the staff sang to three other parties.

We had booked a reservation for a special birthday dinner, eagerly anticipating the wonderful evening we've had at STK locations in other cities, especially in NYC. However, our excitement turned to shock and dismay when we arrived at the restaurant. The pictures, reservation confirmation, and even the menu from the OpenTable confirmation were all entirely misleading and false.

To our disbelief, upon arrival, we discovered that the restaurant was closed. The gentleman said “if you haven’t had STK before this will be similar.” I was baffled! We were redirected to an upstairs terrace, which was more reminiscent of a crowded bar scene than the elegant dining experience we had envisioned. The limited menu provided fell far short of our expectations, and to add insult to injury, we were subjected to people smoking around us. This was a far cry from the celebratory atmosphere we had hoped for and experienced in other STK locations.

The waiter was unable to open a bottle of wine, steak was cooked and presented horribly, and service was not good. It is honestly a disgrace to call yourself STK, it’s ruining your reputation, and turning away customers for future visits.

What truly baffles me is the complete lack of communication. Not a single word of explanation was given in advance – no email, no phone call, no attempt whatsoever to inform us of the situation. Had we been made aware of the changes, we certainly would not have chosen to dine in such an inappropriate setting.

If I could erase this meal, I would. I am embarrassed for STK.                     1 person found this helpful          Report        JB   JennyB   Yorkshire          1 review                              5.0           1 review    Dined on August 1, 2023     Overall  5    Food  5    Service  5    Ambience  5      STK was a brilliant place to eat during our trip.

Ho trovato Terrazza Calabritto mentre cercavo un ristorante speciale dove portare fuori gli amici.  Dopo aver letto un paio di recensioni ho pensato di provarlo.  Da dove cominciare?  

Il personale?  Eccezionale!  Cordiale, competente, appassionato dell'arte del cibo che servono e anche dei vini.  

La posizione?  Un fronte non presuntuoso che rivela una bella zona pranzo nascosta nella parte posteriore che può aprirsi tempo permettendo!  

Il cibo?  Fantastico!  Un vero amore per quello che fanno passa attraverso l'equilibrio dei sapori e la presentazione.  

Il servizio?  Non ricordo l'ultima volta che ho voluto scrivere una recensione per ringraziare lo staff di un ristorante, dal proprietario all'intero piano.  

Grazie per un'esperienza straordinaria per la cena.  Ci tornerò sicuramente quando tornerò a Milano.                     Is this helpful?

Siamo rimasti dispiaciuti per uno spiacevole incidente da parte del giovane cameriere che ci ha servito la mozzarella fritta con tartare di tonno. Mentre serviva la mozzarella questa è caduta sul tavolo e ha pensato bene di riprenderla e metterla nel piatto ugualmente. 
Capiamo che a volte un incidente può succedere ma in tal caso sarebbe più carino dire “le riporto un piatto nuovo dalla cucina”. In compenso era davvero ottimo!

I met our waiter who quickly became the party planner named Giovanni. The evening turned out to be one of the most enjoyable and fun dining experiences we have ever had.

I love anything melon, especially like honeydew or cantaloupe. The drink was divine! Smelled and color of fresh sweet cantaloupe!

The appetizers were great, we had the burrata and the vegetable pasty (not actually the name). Both had flavor and were very authentic to taste. For our meal the winner was the veal meatballs, filling and rich.  We also had the ravioli filled with carbonara  filling and the angus beef.  I would say the only thing they were low on salt but easily remedied by adding it.  The service was very attentive and the atmosphere was chic without being stuffy.  A nice place to celebrate an event.                     Is this helpful?
