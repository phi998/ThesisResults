None of the details were passed on even though I called to confirm them earlier in the day. Server only became interested after he gave me the machine to pay and asked everything g was ok. Once he noticed a small tip he became very attentive...as we walked out the door. Good spot if you’re a regular the restaurant staff recognizes. Not so much otherwise.', 'The restaurant was operating on a reduce menu that was a fraction of what was advertised on their website.

The location is really nice, the building architecture quite a stand out and the service I believe was first class. I was also impressed by the cleanliness. We did a little bit of wine tasting on site at the cellar door before we dined and I ended up purchasing 3 different bottles or red wine to take home.

I think we made the right choice!', 'Always love our visits! Perfect setting, great service and simply delicious menu.', 'Lovely divine space and excellent service. Not that impressed with the food, beautifully prepared and looked stunning but did not like the combinations. Best bit was bread and beautiful hummus.

Service is outstanding. Music incredible.', 'We had to wait outside in the cold for almost 25min to enter which was so inconvenient and doesn’t apply to the fact that reservation & package bought should be an advantage to skip lineups..I had spoke to Megan on the phone to have a special table close to the stage assigned to celebrate my anniversary on the same day and got confirmation about that but the waitress accommodate us in very poor high table close to exit door..I had to speak to manager who in the beginning wanted to convince me that this happened because of the high volume of people but she wasn’t convincing at all and I had to wait till she decided to move us in a better high table close to the stage which was my request since I had reservation..the mood changed for sure after what happened and took us time to get back to normal..it wasn’t good experience regarding accommodation but we enjoyed food & music..but I’d never come again for such celebrations.', 'Awesome!!!!!

Our seat was not close and there was not an unobstructed sight line. We got the steak and while it was good, it was not well priced.', ""The vibe and the service was Fab. One thing I would really recommend Lula Lounge to look into - Ask servers to be considerate when they are serving VIP tables in the midst of a performance. I had to watch a server pour 8 glasses of champagne while he stood right in front of the performers for a good 5 mins (I counted the glasses). Either change the seating layout for VIP tables or ask your servers to be mindful. I mentioned this to the person serving us, I was told that Lula minimizes interruptions while serving VIP tables but that wasn't the case. I hope someone reads this and acts on this at Lula"", ""The atmosphere and stage, dining set up at Lula Lounge is spectacular. I had the jerk chicken dinner, which was outstanding and substantial. I also had a Songbird Cocktail that looked and tasted divine! Kudos to the bartenders and chefs who make the whole dining experience absolutely stellar. Our service was not up to the high standards one would expect based on the food and ambiance, though. Our waiter was not the most easygoing, and rushed to bring us the bill before the set was done, and before we could order dessert. There was plenty of time for us to have had dessert and paid up before the set ended, to allow staff to clear up for the next show. So I have to say I was surprised. The show we attended, the Etta James Tribute was absolutely spectacular! The line up and the the host band, Bad Luck Woman, just rocked the house! I could not believe the energy and musical showmanship they all brought to the evening. Absolutely flawless! We will be coming back to Lula Lounge regularly after this. We were just blown away! I honestly can't say that I know of many other venues in Toronto"", 'ESA Performance', 'Been to Lula many times. This time was a disappointment as the choice of food was too limited and how badly prepared not to have chicken. The price for a small steak, quite fatty, was $44.00 which is ridiculous as there was little else on the plate. Although we tipped and we should not have, the service was not good, we felt rushed and we were rushed especially near the end of the concert when we wanted to enjoy dessert and coffee and the server said the kitchen was closing, even though the concert was still going on. The saving grace of the evening was the wonderful music. We will be in touch with the organizer and tell her of our disappointment and could she find another venue.', ""In terms of today's ability to communicate with customers, your web site's food menu had considerable changes to what was really happening once we go there. Maybe a more labels on your lovely pictures would help, and hey, why NOT put the prices out there plain and simple, cause let's face it, by the time the little extras to the 'fix prix' get completed, you never know what you've paid for! Complicated for any one who might like to advance plan....share? The venue is lovely. Service was super except for the one late main(?)."", 'Great show Amazing Food, And all around outstanding Atmosphere. Love this place, Would definitely recommend this place to others. We were a table of 5. Service was outstanding. We are already planning on coming back April 19, Thank You, Nicole and her amazing tram. ❤️❤️', 'Great vibes and great show. Food/Service not worth the price. For $50 per plate I would expect scrambled eggs to be cooked well and not cold. :-(', 'I was celebrating my 21st birthday and had the best experience possible! Started off with a complimentary birthday mojito, a 3 course meal with mouth watering flavours and all cooked perfectly! The calamari was tender, the salmon had a nice crust on the outside and flaked with every bite. It was all perfect! The live music changes weekly, but the band on Saturday night was authentic and very talented in salsa/merengue/bachata music; raggaeton and more Latin pop was also played during the live music intermission to provide music for everyone’s taste. 10/10 would recommend Lula lounge for any celebration or night of fun for the full experience!']",794

The staff was just as amazing and welcoming as the dinner staff. Very upbeat with huge smiles. Brunch was amazing.We rolled out of the restaurant after we had their cinnamon bun for dessert.', 'Otis is, without a doubt, the best new restaurant I’ve tried in the past year and arguably one of the Top 4 or 5 restaurants in which I’ve ever eaten. Everything was superlative. The burrata (with pesto, tomato jam, and sweet potato), beet salad (with whipped ricotta, candied hazlenuts), lamb chops, duck leg, homemade foccacia were each one of the best examples of those dishes that I’ve ever tried in the U.S. or Europe. We’re heading back this weekend for a second visit. Otis marries the quality and refinement of a Michelin-starred restaurant with generous quantities ideal for sharing, a laid-back, family vibe, beyond fair pricing, an awesome industrial chic decor, and just really great juju.

It was as if none of the staff actually wanted to be there and we were a huge inconvenience to them for attempting to dine at Sheffield's. The food was awful - I have had the veggie burger time and time before and this time it was cold, with a few pieces of something very hard (??) that I was forced to spit out.

Waiter service was non existent. Took forever to order juice and coffee. When spending this much you expect a better level of service. Ordered a mimosa to find that it was an extra charge on top of the $36 per person brunch. When bill came an 18% gratuity was already added. I did not want to leave any tip I would never pay to eat that way over priced brunch with no service.', 'Breakfast buffet was below average for price', 'I was hoping the food would be better and that I’d want to come back again. The food is average and the selection was more lunch than brunch. You need more seafood. More desserts. Shorter line for eggs, omelets and pancakes. Our server was very nice and helpful. Too expensive for the food that was available.', 'Beautiful place to spend an entire day!!', 'It was excellent and charming', 'Underwhelming for the price. The food was absolutely delicious though.', 'We had reservations and the restaurant was not crowded but we had to wait almost 10 minutes while they cleaned of a table for us to sit at. After we sat down, we waited another 10 minutes before our waiter came to take our drink order. It kind of made for a sub par experience. I expected more from the service. The food was good.', 'Wait staff completely inattentive. No side dishes in the buffet. A complete disappointment all around.', 'Upon arrival I was informed the restaurant was closed...', 'The food and service were good but way overpriced.

The staff was quite attentive and the view of the Potomac was excellent.', 'The food selection was less than expected for the breakfast at the resort.', 'It was very busy but the staff was very responsive to our needs and requests. Food was terrific', ""While we had a good time and I would go again, I was disappointed and actually a little shocked at the buffet. First of all it has been years since I've been there. The buffet was less expensive but definitely a lot less food selection than when I was there before. We arrived about 1pm and there were only a few other guests dining. Which made me wonder about it... We have a member of our party who cannot do stairs. It took awhile to find the right elevator to get us there. We ended up coming in on the far side of the restaurant and had to walk across the restaurant. There was no one at the podium but someone came up pretty quickly, We had our choice of table and got started right away. The omelet/waffle station was great! Delicious and nice staff. While our server was good I also had to go find him a couple times, but only because it was so dead in there that he would walk around... There were several people standing around with nothing to do. Not a good thing. They should have been refreshing the food, or at least stirring it."", 'The Mothers Day Brunch was incredible with live music, fantastic service and a huge selection of dishes to choose from.', 'I was very disappointed this year by the selection of food and the quality. Poor service, and it was very u organized. Definitely not worth the money you spend!! I tried 4 times to email them about the day and still no one has gotten back to me. Sadly this was one of our favorite places to go!! They have always been amazing. 😢😢😢', 'I would! The selection and variety of foods was very good. I was not 100% happy with the dessert options where variety was not as good. The service was outstanding and we will try to return soon.', 'Great restaurant. Have been going for years. A little larger dessert selection would be nice. They used to offer ice cream :) really, no complaints. Definitely will return to Lansdowne', 'Went for Mothers-day brunch. Disappointed at the lack of service and not worth the money.', ""Couldn't see the limited view for the drapes even though we were sitting at a window table; only one ramp in entire dining area for handicap access; the only tables on the same level as the food were for large groups only; staff were unaware of location of elevator; the only elevator found was a freight elevator, unmarked on either level so I think it was not supposed to be for guests; wait staff were pleasant, attentive and very helpful - the only bright spot in our experience; brunch food was standard fare, no signature dishes and not kept cold/hot very effectively (in the 20 seconds it took to return to my table, the prime rib was already cold); the whole resort was terribly understaffed, including the restaurant."", ""Went there for brunch and the quality did not match the price point. The price was too expensive for the quality of food. Eggs were made from powder, mac n cheese was bland and a step less than Kraft. Meats were tender but bland. I've had better food at golden Corral . The smoked salmon, waffles and mashed potatoes were great. Staff was exceptional and polite. I will continue to go to founding farmers if I'm going to drive out of my way for a good brunch."", 'Dinner was a buffet for $50+ and the meal consisted of hot dogs, well done burgers, cold friend chicken and a few other things. You have to go get you own drinks out in the hallway. Hard to get any service at all. Been there numerous times with a much better experience. Hard to believe this is a still considered a first-class hotel.', 'Poor food selection. Not worth the price. Food that they had was good though. Left hungry.', 'Great food and service, loved the omelette and bloody mary for brunch!', 'We went for a father’s day brunch. We ordered bottomless mimosas but the waiter never came back to give us another one until we paid the check. Many things were empty on the brunch and the omelet and waffle bar only had one person working so wasn’t worth the wait. We may try it again when it’s not so busy. I think they were just not prepared for a crowd.', ""We went to the Christmas buffet last year and you can't even compare this year to it. There was less food and the quality went down. To begin with, there were no holiday decorations coming down the long hall to check in for the buffet. Absolutely nothing conveyed the holidays. I believe last year there were 3 Christmas trees . Between all of us at the table, we tried several of the breads and all of them were dry and cold, as if they recently came out of the refrigerator. The prime rib was fair. The service was so slow picking up the plates, we had several stacked up on the corner of the table. There was a gentleman that played holiday music on an electronic piano keyboard. He was mediocre and dressed casually. The desserts were dry, except for one that had chocolate mousse. I was embarrassed taking my mother to celebrate Christmas at Riverside Hearth."", 'We went for Brunch on Father’s Day. There were no table clothes on the table which added to the noise level. You could not hold a conversation with your table mates. The service was very poor. Not enough staff for the crowd or the brunch stations. Very disappointing. Will not go back.', 'Our server, Ashraf, was very good... and all the station servers were very friendly. Food prep was also good... nice location.', 'First of all we had to wait over30 minutes to get seated even though we had made the reservation in advance. Second my child missed the egg hunt due to hostess giving us the wrong information. She told us there another egg hunt at 3 pm when the last one was at 2 pm. She should of sent us down for the egg hunt while we were waiting. Food was okay. Nothing was outstanding. They tried to charge us for drinks we didn’t order', ""We thoroughly enjoyed going to Riverside Hearth for Thanksgiving brunch. My parents-in-law came to this country for the very first time last spring and this was their first-ever Thanksgiving in America. Besides our young son, we were accompanied by my wife's cousin and her husband who are newlyweds and making their first trip to Lansdowne. The selection of foods and spread out arrangement of the food stations was inspired. My family is Asian and was impressed by the Dim Sum choices at the buffet. Our son initially opted for the breakfast choices and for my wife's parents having sausage was like having (in appearance) longganisa, which is Philippine sausage. They were quite amazed when they got up to select the seafood choices and were quite enchanted overall by the surrounding. I was able to point out Sugarloaf Mountain in Maryland in the distance from the dining room where we've climbed before. This was an excellent choice for the day and occasion and I would heartily recommend it."", 'Great food...great service and a great selection of entrees. Our drinks came fast and our waiter was peerfect!', 'The food was lackluster, certainly not worth the price per person. Was surprised that they included the gratuity for 4 people, was glad that I saw that on the bill before I added another tip. The view was very nice, though.', ""For the price we paid, we certainly got our money's worth! The food was very good."", 'New Year’s Eve Family Buffet and fireworks! Amazing!', 'We had a nice Easter brunch with our family. The service staff was outstanding, and the kids enjoyed the Easter Bunny and egg hunt.', 'The Hostess was lovely....not so much the waiter (very slow and charged for 18%gratuity for table of 4). Food was extremely disappointing as well.....past experience years ago was a totally different experience.', 'Poorly managed Easter Brunch. Will not return or recommend to others.', ""We were disappointed in our first visit. The place was not busy. The choice of food in the buffet is limited. The food seemed to have been on the line for a while because there was some discoloration and some crusting have formed. The roast beef was cold and the food on chafing dishes were getting over cooked. Our server was nice, but doubted us when we told him that my daughter was only 12. I have to show her ID so we can prove it. We didn't have any problem with paying the full price, but we didn't expect the reaction when we told our server that she's 12 years old. For the price it charges and the selections it offers, it's not worth it. The view outside was nice. We drove all the way from Lorton just to try if this will be a new place we can go to during our day off. We all agreed it's not worth it. Good try though. 😕"", 'Very good, except my 6 year old kids were charged for the buffet', 'My wife and I had our wedding reception at the Riverside Hearth in 2014 and haven’t been back since. Went for Mother’s Day brunch with my wife and mother in-law. We all had a wonderful time. The variety of food and desserts were great. Emily who was one of the managers checking in the parties was very accommodating and polite. Glad we went back.']",94

This was our first time going to Jacques' Brasserie. The weather was perfect, we had a table outside, felt completely safe, great ambiance. It was a perfect meal."", ""First, let us say that it was evident how hard Jacques Haeringer works to keep this restaurant running smoothly, especially during this difficult time, and he clearly gets his exercise. It has to be a real challenge and we salute him and the staff! We had asked in our reservation to be seated outside and it was a beautiful day, but we were told our table would be inside . I believe this was because a couple without a reservation standing ahead of us insisted on sitting outside and kept the staff occupied for a few minutes discussing where they would sit. We didn't complain and were actually okay being inside as every outside table was taken and we felt safer, given Covid and the number of people dining. Our food was delicious and beautifully prepared. The filet medallions were tender and juicy but strangely, the flavor did not taste like beef. It was lovely to have the wonderful bread and fresh vegetables from their garden. Our server was friendly and attentive, and all the servers were masked. We loved our raspberry souffle', courtesy of Jacques.

Food took a very long time, and in the end, wasn't very good. Vegetable Risotto was watery and tasteless. Mashed potatoes were liquidy (like soup). Wish I took a photo to show how gross it looked. Grilled pineapple was served with grill lines, but was cold in the middle. As if they threw a large piece on a hot grill and took it off right away. Not caramelized in cinnamon or sugar like I've had at other restaurants. They just put a hunk of pineapple on grill and serve it to you. Disappointing. Seabream wasn't bad, but I've had much better.

I got the piri piri chicken with fries and salad, while the chicken was very flavourful it was a tad dry. On the otherhand the fries were on the undercooked side.

I would have liked my dish a little spicier, but not having been there for a while, medium was safe. We had an early reservation (5:30), as one person had to be somewhere else at 7pm. They weren't busy. In fact, we had to wait for them to unlock the door, as the restaurant doesn't open until 5:30. The wait staff seemed hesitant to approach the table; I'm all for them not hanging around, but I also don't expect to have to flag someone down to take my order. This also meant we didn't leave until almost 7. One thing I disliked, was that the staff took the leftovers that were to be packed to go, back into the kitchen.

After waiting about 15min to speak to someone (host, waiter, or otherwise), we were told that even though we had a reservation and there were open tables, we should find somewhere else to eat. We were advised that the wait for food was over 2 hours at that point. Apparently there had been some events earlier in the day that precipitated this issue.

So if you can get past that, then I recommend it highly. I would suggest they invest in a little capital renewal.

I told the Hostess that I was here for the OpenTable Reservation, but the Hostess did not know what to do to find my reservation and was directing me to sit at the bar. Very strange.

They made the meal even more romantic by offering a complementary glass of wine for each guest and presenting each lady with a long-stemmed red rose at the end of the meal. Valentine’s decorations aside, the dining room is a very elegant setting on its own: marble-topped tables, plush upholstered chairs, crystal chandeliers. Service is very courteous and attentive. Dharani’s menu is very extensive, with a broad selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian appetizers and entrees. The cocktail menu is far better than most other restaurants, of any ethnicity and they have a broad selection of liquors. The food was deliciously seasoned, although, the level of spiciness at Dharani tends to be hotter than I have grown used to at other Indian restaurants.

Unfortunately, the incompetent wait staff at Dharani detracted from the food. This could be a excellent, value based establishment. However, the terrible service substantially detracted from our experience: 1. There was no pace to server our order. The appetizer was still being enjoyed (dosa) when all of our entrees were brought to the table. We were expected to lift a large platter make room for our main courses, which were brought out way too early. 2. Halfway through the meal, we were finally able to flag someone down to inquire as to the status of our cocktails. We were told that they were not able to fulfill and order for their 'signature' cocktail and option 2 was also unavailable. 3. Prior to ordering a dish for my mother-in-law, we confirmed with the wait staff that the item as not spicy. To her (and our) disappointment, it was in fact quite spicy. There may be some promise in the food itself, but there are plenty of nearby options that will merit our visit before we give Dharani as second chance.

We were then seated in the taproom which has a fireplace and was very cozy. There was also live piano music which we very much appreciated. However, the food was terrible. The duck must have been cooked from frozen and was tasteless and difficult to cut through. The wine list was shockingly plain and uncreative.

The food is delicious and oh those wonderful bagel crisps.', 'I haven’t been here for decades and there has been a more recent management change but this remains one of the more impressive dining options in this remote and historic part of Connecticut. This is a large, colonial era type venue which includes an inn for overnight guests as well as a spa. The Tap Room is the charming smaller, more casual option which includes a bar with limited table seating and a cozy fireplace. It features low lighting and a comfortable yet “classy” atmosphere with proper waitstaff and a decent menu of fish, steaks and pork entrees at prices that reflect the upper class appeal of the venue. This is not a cheap date destination but it is special and delivers the value of the total experience. They also have a much larger formal dining room which is elegantly decorated with subdued lighting and a fairly modern look for this historic property. Parking is on site and plentiful as the site is isolated just outside the town of Washington, CT. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals although we decided not to indulge in dessert. The wine our waitress recommended was wonderful and her service was quite friendly and professional. I', 'We understand, the limitations that the virus places on spaces, the main dining room felt a little stark. The food was very good, even though, the choices were very limited. Our server, Cory, was delightful. Very pleasant, informative, and polite.', 'Anniversary', 'The food was wonderful. All four of us enjoyed it very much. They were very receptive and accommodating to my husband who is Vegan. They substituted the soup and dessert very graciously. We will definitely return to dine there.', 'I appreciate good food and pay attention to everything when I dine out. It out first time at The Mayflower Tap Room. The wall at our table was dirty, it was drafty, the tables were worn and the chairs were dirty with food... I had a Vodka and soda which was watered down. Our Salmon was too rare and too over priced for a “Pub setting” We won’t return. I wish you well and hope you will pay attention to these comments. I don’t like to write negative comments, but this time it was necessary. Thank you, G. Laviero', 'Beautiful place and the staff are so warm and friendly. I took my daughter for a light dinner and it was very nice. Expensive though - tomato soup, Bibb salad, burger/fries, side of mac and cheese, and one glass of wine was $90 without tip.', ""The food and service at The Tap Room for dinner was impeccable. Our waiter Kevin was kind, attentive, and extremely personable. He made the evening special, answered any/all of our questions, shared recommendations with us, and even brought out a candle and complementary dessert for my mom's 60th birthday without me even having to ask. Kevin is a huge reason why we had such a wonderful evening and meal here, we were not rushed, the food was excellent, and ambiance sitting outside under the stars was beautiful. They even provided blankets for us since it became a little chilly outside after sunset."", 'Always a very enjoyable experience, from the valet greeting to the creative and beautifully presented meal', 'What an amazing lunch! Everything was perfect. Superlative service, delicious lunch, charming atmosphere and a relaxing time. Couldn’t have been better. It cast a special charm to a 65th birthday celebration for all of us. Thanks!', 'The beauty and elegance of the Mayflower setting is worth the trip for lunch or dinner. The Taproom is one of my favorite places for casual, old fashion, clubby dining. An easy menu in a beautiful bar sets the stage for an enjoyable experience. The best thing you’ll eat is not even on the menu… It’s the Parmesan bagel chips! The food is very nice: hamburgers, fresh fish, salads, etc. I’d suggest purchasing a bottle of wine rather than by the glass... you’ll spend less and drink more.! Dining at the Mayflower is not so much about the food as it is about the ambience . There are few places that are prettier than this lovely hotel and spa.', 'Good bar cuisine, interesting ambiance. Our server was excellent. The price was a little on the high side. I recommend dining in the main dining room, near the windows overlooking the gardens. Better/more extensive menu; basically the same cost.', 'Count on $100 per person for a badly cooked and badly presented - diner-style - burger. Astronomical prices for worse food than ever. Auberge better make some fast changes. During our meal here, there was a wine sales rep loudly touting his bottles at the bar. Maybe handle business during off hours and let people endure this over-rated joint in relative peace?', 'We had a very nice Christmas Eve meal at the Mayflower. We felt bad for the servers, as they seemed to be short-staffed. No one waited on us for the first half-hour. No bread, etc. I usually don’t complain, but at these prices...', 'The atmosphere was amazing, the food was amazing and the service was outstanding!

I was sorry to see that Abdo had retired.', 'First visit by my best friend to my new home in Litchfield.', 'Wife’s birthday', 'Overall a good experience. The food was good using fresh ingredients and healthy preparation approach. The service was slow. It took quite some time for our food to be delivered. The service team was professional and welcoming although at times it was difficult to get their attention.', 'We really enjoyed our experience at the Tap Room. The atmosphere was great with the live piano music and the fire. Our service from Francesca was outstanding! We would definitely come back.', 'It was a pleasant evening with friends from out of town.', 'another great visit to the Mayflower Inn. Great place to take out of town guest.', ""Both the tap room and the main dining room are fantastic. The Tap room can be a little noisier when crowded but still enjoyable. The food--lunch is the same menu at both venues--is just wonderful, tasty and tastefully presented. Even the bread and butter is incredible. The servers are knowledgable and not overbearing. It's just an overall great experience. My one complaint is that while there are a few reasonably priced bottles of wine, certainly the reds are generally overpriced and for the better bottles can quickly add 75-100% on your bill. That said--have wine by the glass--and hold off on the bottles until a special occasion. You should not miss this place."", 'Would have given all 5’s, but I am not sure I am “OK” with pets being allowed in the Tap Room. Do not think that pets should be allowed at the table for indoor seating. Seems like too nice a place to allow this.', 'The service was impeccable. Such a peaceful, lovely place!', 'We are NYers with a weekend home nearby and had tried (and sworn never to return to) the main dining room in the past but had never tried the Tap Room. While much happier with the ambiance of the Tap Room, and satisfied with the food, the service level is still nowhere up to par with the price. Seems like they need more waitstaff to take orders and bus tables, and less management standing around looking concerned. Could also invest in some training - the hostess could not answer even basic questions about the resort. Overall experience was ok enough - wine quality and selection, and live pianist were the big highlights. We’ll be back but not too often.', ""the food was all but in-eatable. What has happened? The pasta was a large glob of sauce with pasta floating in it. We won't be back any time soon unless there is improvement."", 'Thought menu limited - only one type of salad.

Otherwise a lovely evening.', 'This was not my first visit, but it was the first time I have visited since they were acquired by the new owner and since the inn and restaurant were renovated. The place was not busy at all, probably due to the Coronavirus shutdown, but service was very slow and inattentive. The food was good but not exceptional and not worth the excessive cost. Note that I had no problem with the cost the last time I was there. I don’t mind paying for quality. But the service and food were definitely not worth the price.', 'Haven’t been here in years and it was such a delight to return. Warm, welcoming and perfect ambience for a great night. Food was excellent-delectable calamari and best lobster roll I’ve had in a while (and that’s including Nantucket and every NYC lobster spot.) Our waiter, Matt, was a true professional; quietly efficient and friendly. Piano player was also a welcome accompaniment to a lovely evening with dear friends.', 'A very nice summer evening... Went for just cocktails and hors d’oerves on the deck, but the service and atmosphere was so nice we stayed for dinner. The lobster roll was an exquisite surprise!', 'Lovely setting. Excellent food. Service became slow after main course .', 'After looking forward to our experience at the Tap Room all week, we were stunned at the poor quality of service. Our waiter abandoned us (we were later told he went home), and it took 45 minutes for anyone else to approach our table.

Being a big fan of Smith and Deli I had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed."", ""Amazing food and wonderful service. We loved everything.

Thanks for putting a candle in the tiramisú for my girlfriend’s birthday :) definitely one of my favourite spots, maybe even my #1 for special occasions.', 'Fantastic food and there was a lot of it too.

Will definitely go back again.', 'Delicious, beautiful, comforting Italian that happens to be vegan! So good. We got the Feast option which was so affordable, delightful and generous. Excellent wine options. And staff were lovely.', 'Great night and food', ""Smith & Daughters was amazing, as usual.

It was a very relaxed and enjoyable lunch."", 'The brunch pizza was fantastic and so was the summer slaw.', ""Great food and cocktails.

Also the ego explosion from the owner on the menu is a bit much."", 'Outstanding vegan food. The carpaccio and the meatballs are just incredible', 'The food and smith and daughters was nice, however we were disappointed by the overall atmosphere and service. The service was very basic, and felt a bit like a food hall. I was there on a date with my partner and it didn’t feel ambient or romantic as it has previously. The fact that they had merchandise for sale felt weird too.', 'We absolutely loved the food here, it was extremely delicious and plenty of it, great value for money. The food came quickly and the wait staff were onto everything. We had both the alcoholic and the non alcoholic drinks pairing which were both delicious! If I was to give any critique it would be that some of the wait staff didn’t seem too thrilled to be there but it didn’t affect our overall experience. Great night!', 'Over all it was a lovely meal, food was excellently executed but we found the menu a little lacking. The starters were really nice and interesting especially the eggplant. But we weren’t so keen on the mains, they were cooked perfectly but after the starters they felt a little un-inspired and very heavy. Would have really liked it if there were less fried dishes and something to cut through the richness of the meal. Desserts were fine but by the time we got to them we were a little exhausted by richness. Staff were lovely, eager to help and talk us through the menu.', ""Delicious food! There is a lot of it so make sure you're hungry if you get the set meal"", 'Service was amazing and environment was also great, but food was okay.. at best. my steak was great but veggies were drowned in so much vinegar that it was horrible and my partners risotto wasn’t great. Very pricy place to eat at with not so great food. Smith and deli on the other hand is completely different and I would recommend everyone to go to', 'We were very excited to be dining at Smith and Daughters which has been on our Melbourne hit list for a long time. Arrived at 7:15, reminded immediately that the table was needed back at 9:00. We ordered drinks, an entree salad to share, garlic bread and a main course each. Drinks and salad arrived promptly then by the time we had divided the salad onto our plates, the mains arrived. Literally one minute after the entrees. We should have asked them to be sent back to the kitchen to stay warm but didn’t want to make a fuss. We just felt incredibly rushed and service could be best described as stern. “Summer salad” was delicious as was the garlic bread ( but expensive at $9.00 for a tiny ciabatta). The carbonara pasta was good but relied heavily on garlic to mask the strange aftertaste. The “roast beef fillet” however was totally inedible. We are not new to vegan food, and we are okay with meat substitutes but this dish not only tasted terrible it actually smelled nauseating. Neither of us could eat it. The plate was left mostly untouched. Our sever did not ask why we left it or', 'Food was great for the most part. We had the \'Feast Me\' option with a dessert. Antipasto was tasty with a special shout out to the garlic chilli foccacia. The slaw with imitation anchovies and pangratatto was delicious. I couldn\'t get enough. Risotto, ragu and tripa followed. I loved the ragu but my husband loved the risotto and tripe dishes. The \\""beef\\"" filet was a miss for me but the apple fritters for dessert were next level. We were still talking about them the next day. The noise level in the restaurant was pretty loud as the place was packed.', 'A great place for vegan & non-vegans to enjoy fantastic food', 'I got served alcohol when I very clearly asked the waitress for a non-alcoholic soda. (I’ve been sober for 7 years). When I went to pay I asked the waitress if the drink I was given wasn’t added to our bill, and she got really rude with me and slammed the receipt in my face and spoke really rudely for no reason. Not going back again.', 'Overall great dine in experience across food, service and ambience', ""Really amazing quality food, for all kinds of diners. My sister (an omnivore) enjoyed herself as much as I (a vegan) did, with every dish we tried being flavourful as texturally appeasing. My sister said her cocktail was delicious also, and there was a range of non-alcoholic drinks so I didn't feel left out. The staff were friendly and explained each dish to us as they brought it to the table, they also were happy to answer the questions we had nor did they try to rush us out of the restaruant even though it was reasonably busy. I have been here once before and I will definitely be going again."", 'Food was incredibleee, staff tainted the experience.', 'Food was amazing and service was fantastic! Will definitely be back.', 'Incredible as always! Delicious food (and so much of it), great venue and excellent service. The opening set menu is great value.', 'Came here for my 21st after wanting to come for months and it was INSANE. Being vegan and Italian it was heaven.

My wife and I routinely come here to celebrate specific anniversaries because the service, food, and ambience are outstanding.', 'We came out for restaurant week and Bellissimo didn’t disappoint. I had the arugula and beet salad that was excellent and my wife had sausage and beans that were equally as good. We both ordered the veal porcini and thought it was really good. They serve the veal thin cut into medallions and topped with lots of mushrooms, onions and Demi glaze. I finished with the meal with cheesecake for dessert. A very good meal, I would recommend going here for lunch or dinner.', ""Restaurant week - what a bargain! Good service. The recommended house Montepulcianno ($35/bottle), was very nice. The persons ordering lamb shanks liked them a lot! My pasta with salmon and peas was bland and needed salt and seasoning. But I'm the one who ordered a nondescript dish. The olive oil served with bread and Parmesan was pale yellow with little flavor - I like spicy ones. We had a wonderful table in private alcove for four people although we had reserved a table online to sit outside. But there were only a couple of unattractive tables for 2 on the sidewalk added for covid.

We couldn’t have chosen a greater place. We will definitely be returning in the future.', 'We came here for restaurant week. First it was great just to find a place that wasn’t part of a chain. All tables were outside—ours was on the sidewalk out front and they had more around the corner carved out from the street. We were greeted by a very efficient runner who not only gave us our setups but offered us each a squirt of hand sanitizer—very nice touch. Every morsel of food was out of this world, from the freshly baked bread served with olive oil and Parmesan. Our apps were a ‘tower’ of tomato and mozzarella with basil. My wife has a pet peeve of being served cold tomatoes and these were perfectly room temperature. I had grilled squid on polenta with the most savory sauce—so much better than the usual fried calamari. My wife had delicious crab-stuffed ravioli in a lobster sauce that, to her delight, were served with a few shrimp as well. Delicious. I had the linguini with scallops and shrimp—perfect sauce, perfect portion—beautiful and so tasty. Even the house bottle of Montepulciano was great for $35. A cannoli for my wife and strawberries sabayon for me—perfected to a great meal. We’ll be back!', 'One of our favorite restaurants. Food is always amazing and the service is outstanding!', 'Good outside table on Main St.', ""We went to Bellissimo for a birthday event and everybody from the party was talking about how great the service and the food were. The staff was friendly, handled our party's needs without any issues, and even gave the birthday guest a special surprise that will be remembered. My only complaint is that I wish there was more on my plate because finishing my meal felt like finishing a really good tv show... You only want more. We will be coming back in the future because now we must try the other items on the menu!"", 'Our meal was decent but nothing spectacular. We were a group of 6 on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was not even half full. Chicken Marsala was the best of the meals I tried. My husband’s lobster bisque had shrimp in it instead of lobster. One of our friends didn’t get the right dinner but settled for what they brought to not have to wait. Cheesecake may have been the tiniest slice of cheesecake I’ve seen. For the food and service, I would go back to Dolce Vita over Bellisimo in the future.', ""Bellissimo was a fantastic experience. The staff was incredibly warm and welcoming. They were very helpful in explaining the menu and in providing recommendations. They had a great and very manageable wine selection. The food was excellent. I strongly recommend doing the gastronomic menu. The chef did a great job providing a variety of tastes and we tried things we definitely wouldn't have ordered (and we loved it). The sidewalk seating is very authentically European. My wife and I cannot wait to go back and we are looking forward to taking our friends and family to our new favorite Italian place!"", 'Took advantage of good weather for outside table on Main St.', 'We were the only diners for most of the experience, and the service was friendly and fine, except that we were seated next to a noisy portable dehumidifier - a strange choice for an empty restaurant. But the real issue was that we found the food sub-par - tough, rubbery chicken with too little of the promised sausage that would have made the dish interesting; a mozzarella/tomato tower that was too cold, lacking in (wilted) basil, and not even made with fresh mozzarella; a small serving of lackluster Costco-like bread, and no cracked pepper for the table. Even the cannoli - my favorite! - was lacking the signature mini chocolate chips that would have made it tasty. The wine list was just OK, yet priced as though it were special. We paid a lot to break our COVID eat-in streak at Bellissimo, then looked at each other saying, \\""We could have done better at home!\\', ""This place was fantastic and the food was amazing, can't wait to go back!"", 'Had a wonderful time, I hope they can make it through COVID. We went and sat in the outside tables for our Anniversary. Great service, everyone was very good at their COVID protections, and the food was delicious!', ""Every dish that we tried was GOOD but it wasn't interesting or exciting. To be entirely fair I went during Restaurant Week so by definition they picked a smaller, universally appealing subset of their menu to mass produce and I knew that was what I was choosing, but that's what it tasted and felt like. Our server was excellent and gave the experience a more elegant feel. He gave me a good wine recommendation and didn't just try to upsell me which I appreciated. He was very attentive and the courses all came out with a well-time rhythm (I'm a slow eater so this is worth mentioning to me!) so you could see that he was attentive and experienced."", 'Except dessert, the overall lunch menu for restaurant week was good. 3-course for $22 is worth not much complaint.', 'pleasant meal, sat outside which is on the street--very noisy', 'Food was great!', 'The mashed potatoes had clearly been plated well before my fish was done as they were cold. Literally, the bites of potatoes and broccoli touching the plate were cold. My husband’s veal was tough. For approximately $35/entree We could have eaten so much better elsewhere. Service was friendly and attentive but we will definitely not be back.', 'My significant other and I dined for the second time at Bellissimo recently. The décor does not wow because the carpet is old and tattered, the placement of dark hardwood floors would be amazing and make the restaurant look refined along with a few other things. Otherwise, there were a few stumbles but this experience was definitely better than the first visit. My significant other ordered the following for his three course meal: Fried Calamari, Lamb Shank with noodles and vegetables, and cheesecake. I ordered the following for my three course meal: Caesar salad, crab ravioli with lobster sauce topped with two pieces of shrimp, and tiramisu. We received bread for the table that was slightly warm and served with an olive oil cheese dip. It was okay but would have been better served fresh and hot with soft butter. My significant other and I shared appetizers, both were good. I am not crazy about lamb, but I tasted his entrée and it was okay. The noodles with the sauce were really tasty. My S.O. loved the lamb and ate every bite of it. His cheesecake was good. My crabmeat ravioli was fine but the lobster sauce was absolutely fabulous.', 'Had the lamb shank and all of the pieces were fatty with little meat on them for around $40. They didnt have the wine they recommended. The food was subpar for how expensive it was.', 'Outdoor dining was a great option.', 'Food was excellent and of great value. We will go back!', 'Went for date night. Staff was very attentive and quick. Food was delicious. Social distancing was done well and temperature checks were done before being seated. We’ll definitely come back. This was our first visit here.', 'I had the special - crab ravioli in lobster sauce... amazing!!!', 'Had not been here for several years. Went back with friends for restaurant week. 3 course menu had nice variety and all of our meals were very good. Appropriate social distancing in place and did not interfere with service or quality. All were in agreement to return again.', 'Noise level is only based on outdoor seating and traffic - not a complaint at all (thanks for having it available!!) Food was delicious and service was excellent :)', 'Not a great place to sit outside. Lots of noise from the street and any foot traffic on a narrow sidewalk.

We'd visited this restaurant several years ago for our anniversary and decided to make a reservation for a belated Valentine's dinner. The only problem with making it two days after Valentine's was that they'd run out of many items on their menu so their menu was more limited. I was really looking forward to some escargot! The only hiccup with this visit was that we had to wait 10 to 15 minutes to get a menu. They promptly filled our water and took our drink orders but after not receiving the menu, we asked for one. Other than that, the service was attentive and excellent. The food was great. My husband had Salmon Wellington and I had Lamb Shank. For dessert we had the sampler platter which I highly recommend!

The outdoor seating area, while temporarily set in an adjacent parking lot, was filled with plants and very quiet and pleasant. We were abundantly distanced from other diners and felt very safe. The food was very nice and well presented, but the standout was clearly the host. He stopped by frequently to check in and chat, but was never overbearing or unpleasant. His warmth and friendliness instead seemed like that of a host at a little town restaurant in Europe. We will return soon!', 'Cafe Renaissance is truly a neighborhood gem. Although unassuming on the outside in a suburban strip mall, on the inside it is intimate, elegant and quiet. The food is superb, primarily French and with an emphasis on fish and seafood. The prices are in line with up market restaurants in the DC area with entrees between $30-40 but worth it. We go there mostly for special nights out.', 'Spent a date night here and it was an amazing experience! Highly recommend for anyone. The owner greeted us very well with warm welcome.

There is a somewhat limited entrée list and out of the selections 2 which we wanted to order were already not available because they were out of both. They open at 5 and are out of both steak and short ribs at 7??????? So we ordered other things that were at best ok and definitely over priced for Playa.

SECONDLY they only open at night and have exceeding poorly lighting so it is very difficult to see what you are eating.

Great food and very good local beers', 'The staff was very accommodating, my reservation request told the staff that is was our 9th anniversary and even though I sprung it on them the day of, they were kind enough to put some flowers and a candle on our table. It was an overall good dinner, with attentive waitstaff, tasty food, etc. I really enjoy this place.', 'First I have to say that the food was excellent all around. We were served some special dishes created by the chef and lunch shift. Those were amazing! The tofu gnocchi were supreme! The filet, steak and salmon were also well-liked. The ambience is okay, nothing special. However, it was far too cold inside. The waiter could not pronounce chanterelle, even after I corrected him. He was nice and polite, but clearly knew very little about food. We had a special dessert created by the chef that had chicken liver, strawberries and maple ice cream. I never expected my husband to touch it – he hates liver – and he loved it! I would never have thought of that combination myself, but it was super.', ""We had a coupon from Localvore and were very disappointed to find it could not be used for their special meal on the first Tues. of the month. We had been really looking forward to the meal. It sounded delicious and was for a good cause. Then we found out it couldn't be used for any specials they have, like half price burgers on Wednesday. The place was crowded and noisy when we arrived, I hope they did well that night. We went for pizza at another local spot instead."", 'The care that goes into giving the customers a really great dining experience shows. Exceptional food for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.', 'Enjoyed the tacos on Mexican night (Wednesdays). Butternut squash bisque with goat cheese and fried sage was superb. Excellent server!', ""Nice specialty drink list, great variety of specialty beers on tap. For those who miss Monty's Old Brick Tavern, you will recognize that the chef has brought some of the memorable items with him such as the bread, the PEI mussels, pulled pork and the broiled fish and chips. The place is vibrant and friendly and always has interesting dishes featuring comfort food items."", 'Nice find in little Hinesburg! Really enjoyed the meal and service was great!', ""The food was good, especially the soups. Wine didn't get to table until last bite of meal, but otherwise nice evening."", ""We ate outside on the lovely deck. The food was wonderful as usual. There's always a new beer on the draught list to try (choices of very and less local) and this visit was no exception."", 'The menu is boring, not enough options, too much orientation to beef and pork and I believe it lacks creativity. A half a dozen burgers is not creative. Our meals were overpriced for what we had. We have visited 4-5 times since HPH opened for business. The bar has obviously become very popular and the noise level during out last visit on 7/6 was disruptive to our conversations. I have discouraged friends from going to the HPH. A couple of times they did try and informed me at a later date they understood what I meant. Once again: overpriced good but not exceptional meals loud boring menu unless you are a meat eater I will continue to share my beliefs with others.', 'We had an excellent time here, it was a Tuesday night and the place was busy, the food was tasty, the panzanella salad was a highlight, we brought our two kids, very kid friendly and accommodating.', 'This public house in Hinesburg, Vt , a Town that is reinventing itself, provides casual atmosphere with excellent food and friendly service. Try the Faroe Island salmon, cooked to order and served with sweet potato and asparagus. The servers are young, pleasant, and knowledgeable about the menu. The wine selection is adequate and local craft brews round out the bar selection. The bar itself shares the same room as the dining room, so the atmosphere is more pub than elegant fine dining, but the food competes with the best in Vermont or New Hampshire.', ""I so appreciate having a venue for good food and good jazz on a Sunday night, what could be better? I drove in from Moretown and it was well worth the drive to see friends and enjoy Jody and her talented band. I enjoyed my burger, cooked perfectly--medium rare... The service was slow and that might have had to do with the great turnout for the music and dining! When I made the reservation I don't recall indicating that I wanted dinner, that might help the management plan for number of meals.....there might not have been enough wait staff, but aside from that....it was a lovely experience, Jody's sound system was great---perfect for the venue and adjustable....that is always an issue for performers...the sound. The space they performed in was perfect, it seemed and with her mixer, she was able to make adjustments as the space filled with people.....thank you so much for your dedication to jazz, community, and good food!!"", 'We found the food extraordinarily good and sophisticated, yet affordable. It was clearly a regional destination restaurant given the license plates. Food was well above expectations - clear focus on local, seasonal foods, including grass-fed beef raised in a field behind the resto. Very cool.', 'Besides the food, one of the best things about HPH is the acoustics: conversation is easy even when the place is hopping! Other highlights: each item on the relatively short and frequently changing menu is yummy, prices reasonable; excellent beer and cider list BUT, most excellently, they take non-drinkers seriously and offer an excellent, artisanal root-beer on tap and several other quality tonics and soft drinks for the designated driver; the desserts tend toward retro-comfort food: chocolate cake with chocolate icing, apple cake, moon-pies.', ""We had a celebration dinner at HPH on Friday night and it was perfect! Relaxed atmosphere, positive vibe from the minute we walked in! The hostess was friendly and warm, our first waiter was Thomas and he was friendly, interactive and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list! He was relieved by Lindsay and she didn't miss a beat--attentive, fun, and friendly! The food was very good and we were all happy with the entire experience! The pretzels with fennel were excellent and the steak was outstanding!!!"", 'Service could use some work. It took awhile for the server to greet us in the very beginning. Then got served our apps without any silverware (we were sitting outside). But we realized the computers had gone down and so maybe there was some chaos because of that. Overall we had a nice time and the food was delicious.', 'I\'ve been to the Hinesburg house a few times with co workers but this past week was an anniversary for my partner and I. The food was amazing and the service matched it. Our waitress was friendly, attentive and she alone would make us come back. Food was excellent and my partner who is from the south exact words were \\""that pulled pork BBQ sauce is no joke\\"" Excellent Food. Excellent Service. We\'ll be back again soon.', ""We had heard it was good for burgers, and found the menu a bit limited. Although the individual prices didn't seem out of the ordinary, the bill seemed high for a mid week dinner for 4 ($150+). We had one soup and salad, two steaks, one chicken echinladas, a bottle of wine and two drinks and one dessert. Everyone enjoyed their food. Service was slow from the time we sat down to the end. We'd probably go back for lunch just to try it again but I wasn't all that thrilled, given that there are lots of better restaurants in Southern Chittenden County."", 'The Public House remains to be a \\""place to go\\"" when you just want a \\""predictable\\"" experience.ie.Good food,good service and friendly,comfortable atmosphere. The staff is always friendly;often w/a visit from the chef to the dining room,when time permits.Soups are not to be missed.All at reasonable prices!', 'We went the other night for the community dinner. Nick was a fantastic waiter. The food was tasty and it was for a good cause. The owner was out in dining room helping.', ""The pulled pork was too hot for my taste. If I'd known it was going to have a little kick, I never would have ordered it. Labeling dishes that might be even moderately hot would be helpful. I also think there needs to be more choices for the dinner menu. On the flip side, I had a bite of the portabello sandwich and that was delicious."", ""I like the Public House for the quality of ingredients and the fact that it's local source. the food tasted good. Polenta was quite tasty; salmon was slightly overcoooked; filet was stuffed with or wrapped with bacon, and it did not enhance the dish. the burger and fries was good, generous portion."", 'Love the atmosphere, good food, great place to meet up with friends. Enjoy the specialty taco and burger nights.', ""Been going to HPH since it opened. They change the menu up often enough to keep things interesting, but still have a great foundation in local ingredients, especially the excellent grass fed beef from Paul List. There's always a selection of beers that come from the central tier of VT (think southern Chittenden county and south), which can be refreshing if you eat and drink in Burlington a lot."", 'Great food, nice atmosphere. Reasonable prices. Will definitely go back', 'We are so lucky to have this restaurant in our town! Great food & drinks in a comfortable environment!', ""Wonderfully varied menu that offers something for everyone from foodies to casual diners. Ambiance is great, bar scene is active with almost entirely artisan brews, ciders, and kombucha. They work with local farmers and source great vegetable, beef, lamb and poultry. Very cool resto option. We're going back."", 'WHat a great asset for the community. Great space, great service and nice people.', ""We arrived and the hostess was great. Kind and friendly to my daughter. Our waiter arrived 20 minutes later and was clearly stoned. He took our drink orders and returned 15 minutes later. My drink had a clear section of glass missing and crack down the side. He returned 20 minutes later to take our order, which took 30 minutes and he forgot my appetizer. The service was horrible and every one at the table had something wrong with their food. The scallops did not specify HOT sausage and was something that my farther should not eat or be surprised by, my sister's Chicken BLT was toasted so much that she could not bite into the bread. The salad was missing vegetables, and the kids menu was very limited and the food was still more for adults."", 'While there was some sandwich selection, for evening meal the menu offered very little. What was offered, was quite expensive for the dining experience.', 'It was bitter cold outside but very comfortable temperature when inside. Our server ,Chelsea, was very attentive and friendly, took our orders promptly and made sure that we had everything we ordered. she also checked back to see if we wanted anything more or that we were enjoying what we ordered. It was a special occasion and the experience was great!', ""We expected a great meal from the Public House based on the brunches. However, our dinner was only good. We both started with the butternut squash bisque. Good, thick soup but seemed starchy (?) I had the chickpea burger. It was too crumbly and could have used mayo or aioli or something. I loved the kale side though. My spouse had the short ribs. He thought they were fine but with the fat & bone, there wasn't as much meat as initially expected. We would try it again since we know they have very good hamburgers"", ""The Public House in Hinesburg was a welcome addition to an area that was absolutely in need of a good bar/restaurant, so I really wanted to like it. First visit was pretty good, but thought it was a little expensive relative to similar restaurants in this area, but the food was good (I had a beef stew). The food on the second and third visits was pretty subpar -- a fatty pulled pork sandwich and an undercooked burger. For a place that advertises itself as a bar/tavern kind of place, those 2 should be pretty solid. This will be my last visit, and I wouldn't recommend this place to friends."", 'Nice selection, good meals, one large party slowed down service, but they still managed it.', '8/22/14 was our 3rd go, once last yr, 2 this; menu < items but over all dining experience quality still excellent.', ""I must admit that I have been avoiding the Hinesburgh Public House since originally trying it last year. After my first experience I felt the food was overpriced with regard to the actual flavor and preparation. I know that they support locally sourced food, so that made it a little easier to swallow. That said, when I took my wife and son to brunch on Mother's Day, I felt the food was good and priced about right for what we ordered, quality and quantity. We didn't leave stuffed and happy and I didn't feel like I'd been robbed."", 'My husband and I are locals and frequent diners at the Public House. The food is farm-to-table and has always been of a very high quality, prepared and presented in an interesting and creative way by chef Sean. The wait staff are friendly and attentive. We also enjoy the jazz group that plays on Sunday afternoons and evenings. One area that could be improved is their dessert offerings. Often the only choice is whoopee pies. In instances where there have been other offerings, the quality is not up to the standard of the rest of the food. The ambience of the dining room could be improved by hiding the bright fluorescent lights of the cooler in the front of the restaurant with a screen. This is a overall a great dining experience!', ""We've frequented here and have always enjoyed the experience, but New Years Eve didn't impress. Our server was awesome ; however, several items that came out of the kitchen were overcooked and they were really really slow. We ate early and the restaurant was far from full. Disappointing.""]",216

The wines and drinks were all perfect band the server was excellent. She was wearing a Virginia Tech mask and our kids and our friend’s kid went to VT so that got us started off on the right foot. She was ver attentive as was her busboy, Carlos, who took great care to make sure there was never an empty dish on the table and our glasses were always full of water. The appetizers were awesome.

She was not only very nice and knowledgeable, she knew when to be attentive, and really understood how to keep her distance as much as possible.

We were seated near the kitchen window and overheard one of the employees complaining that, \\""...they keep messing up...\\"" presumably talking about the kitchen staff, significantly lowering our expectations. My lobster ravioli seemed a bit cold, but I was incredibly hungry, so I ate it anyway. The food was somewhat okay tasting, but it definitely wasn\'t worth the $75/plate fixed menu pricing -- especially at the portion size and food temperature that was served. The table setup in the place was far too crowded, resulting in being way too close to the party next to you, taking away from whatever romantic atmosphere remained in there. The tables themselves were far too small (and felt like cheap poker tables, to be completely honest), probably an intentional selection to cram as many of them in the dining space as possible. Some customers at the bar kept yelling about something, which would interrupt the atmosphere of the dining room.

It was too chilly to dine outside, but we can\'t wait for warm weather again. Their outside is rather nicely appointed and looks fantastic! Inside, at first we were afraid that the band, which was getting set up, would be too loud, so we requested a table toward the back. As it turns out, the band was first of all, excellent, and secondly, performed at a volume level appropriate for their space. It was an outstanding addition to the ambiance. By the way, the live music is every Saturday. Dinner was wonderful. The appetizers alone, while not always easily shared, were creative and well prepared. Our entrees were equally well prepared, mine in particular, the black and blue filet mignon, was excellent. The staff was excellent. Everyone contributed and were attentive without being overbearing. Hannah, our primary server, was wonderful. The manager also recommended a wonderful bottle of wine, Taplin', 'We’re very happy they’ve recently started serving brunch on Sunday. I love the warm and local friendliness of the place. The beignets were excellent. Very interesting menu with some breakfast standards like steak and eggs but some other unusual options that are very tasty. Will definitely be back.', ""This is a lovely spot, but they just can't seem to get their act together. My vodka martini was almost undrinkable (it tasted like a glass of olive juice with a little vodka poured in). The food was fine, nothing special. The service was professional. We've lived in this neighborhood for about 2 1/2 years now, and this place used to be worse. Lately it has improved (both food and service), but our last visit was a bit of a dud. If you don't know how to make a vodka martini, get out a bartender's guide and figure it out! We'll be back, but one day soon we may just give up."", ""My husband and I were eager to try out this establishment for a last minute date night, we tend to frequent places where there is great wine, vegan food, and live jazz. I wasn't disappointed when we arrived, the music was amazing, the decor modern, and classy, and we were seated quickly, ( I made reservations prior). The hostess chose a table for us, which was nice but only ideal to me, unfortunately my husband had his back to the band. After a few minutes of perusing the wine list, we asked a tall gentleman who worked there would it be possible to switch to the table beside us so we both can visually enjoy the band, he hesitated, and relied no. It was a four seat table, so I can understand it being reserved for 4 guests. After an hour or so another couple came in, and they were seated to a two set table behind us, they asked the same tall fellow could they be seated at the 4 seat table beside us, he hesitated but said sure. Now my husband and I both looked confused as to why our requests wasn't granted and theirs was. We decided"", 'Great small plates and an impressive wine list.

Much as I enjoy live music, I was dismayed to see a jazz trio letting up, as we arrived, because I was afraid we wouldn’t be able to hear each other speak. The staff quickly sized up the situation and led us to the patio, where we sat in a gentle summer breeze, listening to muted but still enjoyable jazz in the background, and conversing over delicious bison kebabs, glazed salmon, vegetables, and salads. It was a delightful evening in an unexpected oasis in the city.', 'It was a lovely dining experience. Service was good and the food was good also.

Everything I tasted thus far is super fresh prepared and delicious for someone like me who loves Mediterranean cuisine. On balmy summer nights, my friends and I love sitting outside - listen to the traffic go by and taking our time enjoying our meals and drinks. Just like in Europe. No pressure by the staff to eat and go. Love their special events like wine-tastings, and increasingly more live jazz events.', ""One of our first Phase One reopening meals - it was good to sit outside on the patio and eat something I didn't cook for myself!

The management was so kind to us in putting us at a window and the server Joel was amazing!! So kind to our daughter and other kids and had great recommendations. Made us feel at home.', ""I had a higher expectation. I thought it was average. Oysters were ok. The hanger steak was flavorful. The fries were less than average. Waitress was slow and not very attentive. Didn't offer suggestions. Was hoping for better."", 'Came in to check out the new menu since the change from Dutch yummy tomato salad, plus a filet and side of broccoli. Perfect for sharing. Look forward to coming back.', 'Best oysters in the city and excellent service.', 'Everything was terrific and a great reflection of the Swift & Sons reputation in Chicago', 'Cucumber Margaritas were excellent, oysters were delicious. Steak Sandwich was below average (their sister restaurant is known for their steaks - this was chipped beef at best) and the inchworm in my salad was gross. I was not charged for the salad but it also caused my friend to stop eating his salad. When we asked for the bill, the server said that they wanted to bring us dessert. When I told them that my elderly mother doesn’t like to drive after the sun goes down, he just remarked, “ok, we’ll get you next time”... but nothing was offered. I understand that the Covid situation offers difficult opportunities - such as lack of staff, stress, alternate suppliers. But I would think that a restaurant of Swift and Sons’ stature and reputation would make more of an effort to ensure that three of us left that night with a good impression. None of us did.', 'Great date spot during the week. Great food and service!', 'For the price, just go to the regular Swift & Sons. You’ll get way more bang for your buck.', 'SO great. Service was excellent. The decor is fantastic! Oysters were super fresh and delicious and all the menu items we tried were excellent. Great wines. Would recommend in a heartbeat.

Thank you, all!', 'Great location right across from Wrigley Field. Sat upstairs with the windows open on a gorgeous day. It was perfect!!', 'Such a lovely dinner!', 'This was not a good experience. We had 5 + a baby in a stroller. Reservation was made for 5 people. The hostess told me upon arrival “we didnt realize you had so many guests in your party”. She sat us in a booth then we were told we had to move bc there were too many people at the table. It was 45 min before we were even served a drink. The server was nice but it felt very uncomfortable and it took 2.5 hrs to have dinner here. We had to ask for silverware and service was slow. We had 2 children with us and we came here for my Mom’s birthday. We skipped dessert altogether bc we just didnt want to sit there any longer. The 3% covid surcharge at the end was enough for us to officially have had a bad dining experience. When you buy $50 steaks and $18 drinks you shouldnt be paying a percentage charge. I would be ok w a flat fee. But a percentage is egregious. I think Ill stick to the West Loop Swift and Sons. Such a better experience. This fell way short.', 'Fabulous experience from start to finish. Service was attentive and informative. Excellent job at abiding by social distancing guidelines and Covid safe practices. Happy hour specials are a great value. Giant pretzel is a must order. We received a complimentary margarita at the end of our meal. Definitely looking forward to returning.', 'The charred oysters were amazing! The food was really explained from the server Alec. He was very attentive and accommodating. There was no game and we went on a Sunday so it was quiet.', 'Joe was very good, great time and food delicious.', 'Perfect location. Very clean.', 'Not impressed with the food. The server said a Aged Ribeye steak would be sliced for the steak sandwich and it was served as a open faced chopped sirloin. Mussels were serves in a huge bowl but barely any mussels so it didn’t fill the bowl up even half way. Just wasn’t impressed.', 'Legit the best wait staff. So kind and considerate and extremely accommodating', 'Very good waiter. Great view of Wrigley and the Oysters were amazing.', 'Great place to watch a Cubs game and hear it across the street! The cheeseburger was really excellent, and the service was friendly and professional.', 'They are doing a wonderful job making sure everyone wears masks, spacing tables apart and taking your temperature before your seated. We came on National Oyster Day to enjoy some oysters. They were fantastic! We tried several different types. I had a Manhattan cocktail which was delicious. We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip which was great, but the chips they served them with were too salty for me. Our server was very pleasant. All around a great night and we so appreciate the staff being there to let us enjoy a night out.', 'Service was abismal with little to no explanation of the issues. Had two tables, one got their entire meal before it was even acknowledged that the other tables appetizer hadn’t arrived.', 'Great Wrigley location! People watching galore! Very Covid friendly!', ""Firstly they sat us downstairs (inside) when my reservation was for the upstairs patio- had to flag someone down and it took way too long to get seated where we actually reserved. Service was lackluster one minute we had to waive them down to order, the next they were trying to clear our plates while we still had a half plate of oysters. When we got the bill we were so annoyed that we had been bamboozled.... there were signs as you walked in and a special place card at the table saying $1 oysters and $4 drafts on game days. It wasn't until we were charged full price that we saw it says in small font below (from first pitch to last out) We literally paid our bill as the first pitch was thrown... I think any decent waiter would tip you off to this when you're ordering dozens of oysters... what a rip off- never again!"", 'Our server was excellent. The staff helping him were very friendly and fast. The food was delicious. My kids had a great time.', 'Great service, pretty good food, salad was underwhelming, steak was ordered medium rare but was delivered extremely rare. Good taste otherwise, but overpriced for what was served. Oysters were the only good value.', 'Best oysters in the city. Amazing staff.', ""Great first-time brunch experience, would definitely go back for drinks and oysters. I loved the variety of options, flavors and the overall ambience. Fortunately it was an early brunch so it wasn't overly quiet and the upper level was perfectly spaced out. I had been dying to go for some time and highly recommend the frozen cucumber margarita. Our server, Kaiya (sp?), was phenomenal and very attentive."", 'Oysters, especially the grilled oysters, as well as the drinks, appetizers and dinner were outstanding.

We were celebrating my Dad's 88th birthday. I had high hopes for the weather and reserved outside seating for 6. When the weather is nice, the setting overlooking the Tysons area is unique. They honored my request, but unfortunately the weather was very cold Sunday evening and windy. That did not stop this classy establishment from quickly setting up a table for us inside. Even though they were completely booked for the evening, Manager Kevin stepped in and made it happen. We always ask for Steven as our server and they made sure we were assigned to his table. I highly recommend asking for him - he knows the menu real well and made a very good suggestion for one of our guests who was finicky about the type of fish she was ordering ! Steven made a good suggestion and collaborated with the Chef to make it a beautiful shrimp scampi dinner. Sea Bass was excellent and the filet mignon (my mom is very picky with her food as well) was good exactly the way she had requested. Definitely try the mac and cheese and Au gratin potato side dishes They brought a complimentary Banana Foster"", 'Celebrated a Birthday Dinner and it was awesome Ida was perfect.', 'This restaurant is our go-to for most special occasions.

The best part was one appetizer...lobster tacos. Those were excellent. The rest - from cocktails to filet to salmon - was just ok.

Fantastic menu. Only problem is the chef butchers it. Just awful. We had dinner there for our 25th wedding anniversary. It really looked like it was a perfect place to have a romantic dinner. Everything was overcooked or burnt or just lacking seasoning and flavour. Chewy octopus. Waxy fois Gras. Salmon steamed or poached to death. Pretty expensive and you can tell the servers know because they’re a little sheepish.', 'The food and service was spectacular! It was above our expectations. We will definitely be back again!', 'Lovely food, we had a 4 course dinner with wine pairing. Everything was great, fois gras, rack of lamb, veal, great dessert as was the wine, mixed from PEC and international. I would highly recommend this restaurant. They have lots of different rooms which is good for social distancing. Certainly a fine dining restaurant', 'There were two seatings for dinner , understandable during covid times in order to manage. However we arrived at 8:25 pm for our seating , no directions on who to see or where and headed inside. They advised our table was running late and to sit back upstairs outside and they would bring us a glass of wine in the meeting- a nice gesture . There were two seating areas with one taken by a group , who had also taken all the seating cushions from our area. Not the restaurants fault , nor the waiter who immediately fought them off for our pillows. Half an hour later we sat down, back inside and down the stairs again, and although there were regular tables inside - they sat us at a high top on the outer area. Our friend has a cane and physical concerns. We sat for another twenty minutes and the waitress came to ask what we wanted- no water, drink order, bread in meantime. We asked for the menu and she’s said “oh didn’t someone tell you it’s on line and to use the QR code? “. Ten minutes later she came back for the order .', 'Nice place but much too expensive for the quality ne taste of the food.', 'Great food, great introduction back into fine dining after Covid. My girlfriend and I were very pleased with our experience at Merrill house. Would recommend', 'We sat on the screened in patio. It was such a nice ambiance. Lots of trees and greenery and it was very quiet. Food was delicious and would recommend. Our server was just the right amount of attentive. Not there too much and not there too little. Would recommend to anyone who wants a really nice dinner.', ""Merrill House was the perfect choice to celebrate my husband's special birthday. The food and service were excellent and with Covid precautions we felt very safe. A special evening!"", 'The food is delicious, French inspired with a Canadian twist. Service was quick and smooth. However there isn’t much ambiance. No music not much people and no view. You are sitting in a basement converted to a restaurant and cellar. Overall worth it because of how delicious the food is.', 'All of your hotels prices are ridiculous for the ambiance and amenities you get in an old house in Picton. I will never recommend you to anyone I know!', 'The food was really good. However the service was very poor. We had the wine pairings with each service and no info was provided on why the wine we were served went well with our food. The waitress was not friendly and seamed like we were being served by a robot. Also the time between courses was extensive. For the money we paid I expected first class service and it was not. I would not go back or recommend.', 'Très joli cadre abrite au milieu d’un jardin, les grillons chantent et de délicieuses assiettes accompagnées de très bons. Et un excellent service! Je recommande!!!', 'Love this place. I have been coming when in town for a few years now. Very cozy and I really loved the new addition! Everything was \\""spot on\\', ""Reserved a month in advance with a special request for our anniversary. We were not in the main house but rather in the outside extension. We order some wine as the Sommelier suggestions on the menu.....the one is not available. I made another selection, the wine was delivered to our table but not opened for at least another 10 minutes even though the 1st course was served. The wine was really good. The one of the main course (Lamb) was very greasy as well as the vegetables. The veal was very good and the portion was good. I wouldn't recommend the restaurant for a few reasons: 1) the server was not very attentive 2) the $90 price for a three course meal didn't live up to the expectations. 3) The special request for our anniversary was completely ignored . We traveled on a continuous basis and based on our experience at other locations, this restaurant is overpriced. The three courses meal should be priced at around $65 not $90. I would recommend eating at the Blumen restaurant instead. The food, service and ambiance is much better"", 'This was simply awesome! So glad to be able to partake again now dining is back open to non-inn guests! From the prix fix menu to the wine pairings to the service - all top notch! So happy!', 'Definitely worth booking dinner for the ambiance. The food ranged from excellent (tomato salad and lemon dachoise dessert) to fair for the pickerel and veal.', 'Just before we left to go to the restaurant, we saw quite a bit of negativity on the reviews. We went with an open mind. Our experience was fantastic. Service was professional, knowledgeable and prompt. We did the 5 course with local wine match up..and both the cuisine and wine pairing were great. Octopus, Gnocchi and Duck, followed by a very large cheese plate and refreshing dessert. Tables in the wine cellar were properly spaced and the ambiance was perfect. Our experience was excellent.', 'Had extremely high hope for this dining experience and was sadden very quickly with the main course. Took the daily dish and it was very blend, lacked flavours, felt we were eating at grandma’s house. For a restaurant with so many great reviews we were expecting an outstanding meal. The vegetables felt like they were frozen, tasteless and over cooked, nothing special, unfortunately. Amazing service the location is prime and very trendy but the menu needs to be revised for more punches of flavours, especially at this price. Actually very expensive for this level of cuisine. Even after telling our waitress of our disappointment, nothing was offered to us to try to salvage the evening. Really too bad. Great selection of wine however, we were told the chef has been there for 14 years, unfortunately many one too many years. I’m really saddened to write this but people need to wake up in this Covid era and really step it up- even more so in restaurants!', 'This was our first in-restaurant dining experience during COVID-19, and it was a wonderful evening - from the warmth of the reception, the thoughtfulness of the serving staff, the awesome food and wine pairings, to the warm embrace of the room, it was truly a special And memorable evening. We will be back!', 'Server we had last night is not passionate at all. Food is not delicious (beef tartare/smoke Salmon has no flavor), garnish for all is very similar. Will not return.', ""We were really looking forward to eating at the Merrill as my parents had been several years ago and raved about it. Tonight, however, was disappointing (for our entire group of 4, which included my parents). The dining room lacks ambiance, the service was slow (even with reduced numbers due to COVID-19), no a la carte options were available (only a tasting menu at $90 for 3 courses), and we chose wine pairing for $55. My mother chose a red wine at $19 a glass. The waitress returned and told her she no longer had that bottle by the glass and offered her a similar wine by the glass - what she failed to mention was that the wine was $30/glass and not $19/glass. For the wine pairing, she didn't show us the wines or let us taste them before settling on one. In my experience at higher-end restaurants, the client is always shown the bottle and given a taste before accepting a wine. Dinner for 4 cost us $700. Nothing wowed me from the ricotta gnocchi to the veal to the hazelnut dessert. Sadly, I will not return to the Merrill Inn."", ""We had an amazing evening at the Restaurant at Merrill House, thanks primarily to our waiter/sommelier Thierry, whose wine pairings were simply magical. Thierry's exceptional knowledge of both local and import wines was truly masterful, and his energy and passion for food and wine permeated the atmosphere and made our experience even more wonderful. Thanks to all for a memorable evening."", 'Absolutely amazing food and service. Perfect night', 'Our service was exceptional. Will definitely go back. Dined in the covered and screened in patio.', 'All three courses were memorable from our dining experiences through the years- a marvellous anniversary dinner', 'Wedding anniversary away from home. Excellent meal and setting. Steak Tartare was the best ever!', 'The food was very good. The service also was good. But it was very expensive, even compared to Toronto restaurants. The music was awful. It was a poor version of smooth jazz, whch in turn, is a poor version of real jazz.', 'Excellent food quality...i went before 2 years ago in June 2018 and the food was amazing..the service and ambiance are just great', ""The food is delicious, the service was very good. They respect the regulations on max capacity in their dining hall. The only issue is that we felt it's overpriced."", 'We took the 4 courses dinner with the wine pairing.. Everything was good! The foie gras en torchon was delicious! We will go back :-)', 'The restaurant is expensive but food and wine are delicious!', 'I want to be understanding and generous given the challenges of COVID for restaurants but Merrill House simply doesn’t deliver the food or experience to merit the price. The appetizers and desserts were above average but the mains disappointed and were unmemorable. The veal was tough and my husband’s meal was served so cooled that it needed to be reheated. We ordered the wine pairing menu and the choices were good but think we would have saved money if we had simply ordered the same wines by the glass. Also our wines accompanying the main course were not served until well after our meals had arrived. The $90 cost for 3 course is way too much for the food and experience offered. Given the rating it gets on review sites, and our expectations for a special evening it left us feeling a bit scammed.', 'A perennial favourite of ours. The new owners have taken it to the next level. Chef Sullivan is, as always, creative and the presentation is beautiful', 'Wine is overpriced for a glass and a lot of it was unavailable. Food was good. Service wasnt the best. Not much of an atmosphere.', 'We had a fabulous time! Wonderful food and had GF options as well.', 'Absolutely fabulous in all areas!', 'It was very nice. Chris, our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. Good Covid safety. Expensive.', 'The same great food as chef hasnt changed however I preferred the ambiance with previous owners.

The menu was extensive, but there were many items that we were unfamiliar with and our waiter not only could not offer any ideas, input, but we had a very hard time understanding him. He had not tried any of the various dishes/items we asked about, which is not a good thing for a waiter to say. They have a wonderful happy hour menu (the waiter did NOT tell us about it), but another table was talking to their waiter about it and we had to go find an empty table that had the happy hour menu on that table, which was not on ours!

The waiter we had was an Indian male, he was very kind and served us well. We had an issue where one of the meals we ordered was not something that one of our party members liked. It was a sushi dish with cucumbers in the center and it was drained in a vinegar dressing. It wasn't a bad dish, it was just something that we personally did not like. We were a party of three and we all tried one piece (the dish only had 3 dishes). So we technically finished it, but our third person didn't enjoy it at all and got one piece.

My friend (who is a regular) and I ordered a mojito each and they were both weak and tasted nothing like a 'real' mojito - so much so that I wondered if they were an expensive, watered-down, non-alcoholic version, but at the full price still. My friend enjoyed her meal (oysters and prawns) but the sweet potato curry I ordered was like bland mush. FYI - I had dined there on a previous occasion with another friend who is an ex-chef and she thought her chicken dish was boring and bland, so has no intention of dining there again.

My significant other ordered the following for his three course meal: Fried Calamari, Lamb Shank with noodles and vegetables, and cheesecake. I ordered the following for my three course meal: Caesar salad, crab ravioli with lobster sauce topped with two pieces of shrimp, and tiramisu. We received bread for the table that was slightly warm and served with an olive oil cheese dip. It was okay but would have been better served fresh and hot with soft butter. My significant other and I shared appetizers, both were good. I am not crazy about lamb, but I tasted his entrée and it was okay. The noodles with the sauce were really tasty. My S.O. loved the lamb and ate every bite of it. His cheesecake was good. My crabmeat ravioli was fine but the lobster sauce was absolutely fabulous.', 'Had the lamb shank and all of the pieces were fatty with little meat on them for around $40.

This resulted in a nearly 30 minute wait. If it were not for the very nice host, I might have left. They did give us a great table.

The waitress Amber did a good job, and being outside on a beautiful evening with a beautiful view pretty much saved it for me.', 'I called and left a couple messages for the owner we were reviewing the restaurant for possible rehearsal dinner. No one ever called me back. Upon arrival I again informed them of this; nothing. The reception was confused, the kitchen was backed up and the food arrived an hour after our reservations and burnt scallops! The presentation was terrible! The bar has limited choices. And the owner doesn’t seem to care.', 'Knowing that our reservation wouldn’t get us outdoor seating would have been nice. Our first choice wine was out of stock. We had to ask for utensils and for salty and pepper. The crab and avocado egg rolls had no avocado. I never got my salad. The steak was drowned in garlic butter. Our waiter was very nice, but inept and couldn’t open a bottle of wine. It became funny after a while, but we didn’t stick around. We went down the street for dessert. Not your typical anniversary dinner.', 'DO NOT order the avocado toast for brunch. It was a very thin spread of avocado, very very very thin.', ""Madigan's deck is a nice place to dine in October. There was a live band playing on the deck that we enjoyed. The server was new, but pleasant and attentive. We just had soup and an appetizer, so I can't comment on the dinner values. I ordered the crab appetizer with crabby tots, crab dip, and crab cakes. The crab cakes were good. Putting crab on tots is a waste of crab and the dip was the same as the crab chowder my friend ordered. I wouldn't order that again, but I would order the crab cake dinner. Lovely view, sitting right at the river's edge."", 'Went for our anniversary. Was not disappointed.

Only problem I had was I've never been there before and made an online reservation but needed to have specified sitting on the deck right on the water. That needs to be more clearly communicated somewhere on the website. The woman who greeted me and the entire wait staff was amazing! I did have a problem with my food. I ordered something that is usually prepared raw but I asked to have it cooked, the chef said they would, but the food came back raw anyway. So I did not enjoy my meal at all. The prices are high, but you seem to get a good amount of food."", 'So obviously being right near the water is what drew me to choose this for date night. However, the food was mediocre at best. The bread was stale, cold and the butter was cold so I couldn’t spread it easily. The salad was gross.. the croutons (which they forgot and I had to ask for, were stale as well) some of my cucumbers we brown on the edges. I ordered a steak and it was ok... but not worth the 18.99 price point as the mashed potatoes had no flavor and I had to request butter for them and had to salt them.', 'Food was bland and boring. Totally straight from the freezer, reheated through whatever method and onto the plate. Fish was over fried and dry, French dip was overcooked and NEEDED the gravy. Super difficult finding a parking spot as well. Only redeeming factor is the service. Our last time here for eating for sure.', 'We always enjoy Madigan’s. Our server was amazing. The only downside was that it was karaoke night in the bar and it was not closed off to the dining room. When I’m paying $200+ for a family dinner and drinks I’d rather not be serenaded by the local talent (or lack there of). This is coming from someone who loves a good karaoke night. Fortunately this only impacts a portion of our experience.', 'I am not going to completely bash this place. They tried, but not hard enough.

We wanted to eat at the place we had our wedding reception....bad Idea i guess', 'There was four of us that went in last night for dinner, I made a reservation since we are from out of town and not familiar with the area. When we arrived, I soon realized a reservation wasn’t necessary but never mind that. We were sat in the bar area, which we requested and the bartender came over and took drink orders. Drinks were good so no issues there. I ordered the 12oz prime rib with mashed potatoes and a vegetable medley. My prime rib was cooked correctly but it tasted like pure fish and had at least 6ozs of fat on it. The potatoes weren’t too bad and the medley was not very good. Another one of us got crab legs and they were drenched in old bay and the smallest/thinest crab legs I’ve ever seen. Needless the both of us left hungry after a $35 meal.', 'Sat in a back corner facing a wall and next to the kitchen even with reservations. Asked for other options to be moved. Our happiness was clearly not a priority. Mediocre food. Peas, carrots, beans and corn in cream of crab soup...odd', 'The only reason I gave 1 star for food and service is because I couldn’t give a zero. The ONLY good thing about this restaurant is the location. Good for a drinks out on the patio but the food is awful. Our waiter ignored us for 15 minutes. Then we had to ask for drinks, bread, refills, our check. It’s like we didn’t exist. He wasn’t busy!! There must have been a ten waiters and waitresses there and I don’t even think each one had more than two tables. My salmon was so over cooked it was shoe leather.

She had to be reminded of our orders multiple times. The side vegetables and mashed potatoes were cold, and the salads were wilted. The prime rib was barely edible and over cooked. When we asked to speak to a manager an assistant cook came to speak with us. He said he needed to talk to the manager after hearing our concerns. The manager never appeared but they did comp one of the four meals.

The service was not great, our waitress was MIA a lot (don't know if she just wanted us to have privacy or she was inattentive), but I did see other servers around more than our (thought about giving 4 starts for that).

We shared what we had, then with dripping, sticky fingers noticed we had no napkins; we asked Waiter C. and he brought them...maybe five minutes later. We also had to ask for water to be poured.

At the end of the meal, I tried to hand', 'The food is good but the service is adequate at best. We had to ask for things. I get that my salad was a “side”, but I have always thought that salad comes out first. I guess we have to ask.', ""I was really disappointed with the service and the food from Madigans. The waitress was a little disorganized. We had to remind her of items. She mentioned kitchen issues, which honestly were a big deal. It took an hour to get our food on a Monday night. They didn't appear to be super busy, but I couldn't believe it taking that long (hubby got fish tacos, i got pasta, kids got pasta and chicken nuggets). I ordered a salad with my meal and never got it. It was a really disappointing experience. I wish we went down the street to the Secret Garden Cafe instead."", 'It was a decent change of pace. Not crowded for a Friday. Karen gave us great service but the food was only average.', 'The food was very good. Hunter was a very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. I wanted the banana cake for dessert, but he informed us that the owners daughter didnt make any and referenced the Madigan Montain (I believe), very tasty and nice presentation, but the sugar was alot. Lol. Could use a banana in it as well. He recommended peel shrimp as well which my girl loved.', 'Food was below average and not worth the price. Mash potatoes were not home made and the 12 ounce prime rib was 50% fat. I did receive a 20% discount on my food due to my displeasure.', 'We went for Birthday lunch and weren’t really impressed. This place has great potential but today must have been an off day. The bathrooms were dirty with an awful smell. On the plus side, the wait staff was great!', 'Meal was good, seafood was fresh and seasoned well. Service was a little slow; probably due to understaffing for a Sunday.', 'This was my first visit to this restaurant. The service was so poor I actually left without eating dinner. They attempted to serve my dinner twice; first time crab legs were cold and second time sent it to the wrong table without the any of the requested sides. It’s unfortunate since it was a nice atmosphere in a beautiful location. I’ve learned my lesson with this experience, take the Open Table reviews seriously.', 'I really cannot understand why it took 10 minutes to seat us when the place was 90% empty. The hostess was more concerned with balancing guests among servers than with the fact that two of our party were over 80 and using canes - she walked us back and forth three times trying to make a simple decision on a table. The service was slow and inattentive. Given that the place was nearly empty, I cannot explain this.', 'Great service, but limited gluten free options.', 'Menus were stained and dirty. the soup ordered never arrived. The four meals that were served were very average. No ambience at all, no-one at the desk when we arrived, had to go to the bar-tender to ask for service.', 'Beautiful restaurant on the river.

The wait for your initial wine order was exceedingly long. We had to flag down the rodizio servers on numerous occasions. He had to be reminded of the birthday celebration, which we noted on the reservation. The attention to detail simply wasn't there.

Most of the food was up to the usual standard but my fries were well and truly overcooked and very hard and peas were barely warm. The Ivy is usually very good and I always give a good review but after this experience I cannot give a good review.

Our food came out luke warm and one dish was burnt. The servers swapped the burnt dish for a fresh dish which was perfect. However, it was apparent during the visit that the serving staff and kitchen were focused on catering for the large groups and other diners fell by the wayside a little. We would visit again, but not on a saturday night. I would also recommend the restaurant considers restricting the size or number of large groups.

To make amends, she waived the cost of our drinks and offered us a free cheese pizza that had recently come out of the oven.

The place was packed, so I’m glad we had a reservation. The service was friendly and timely. All three of us enjoyed our various pizzas. It ties with my other favorite pizza place in Northern Virginia. This is wonderful because we live across the street from the village center in Leesburg and were hoping for a good pizzeria that we could walk to. The space between Cobb theater and the Indian restaurant is ideal, looking out the large windows down the main drag. There’s a feeling of energy unmatched elsewhere in the center.

The restaurant itself was also pleasant. However the staff, while very nice, were far too intrusive and full-on. From the moment you sat down, there was no peace to enjoy the meal. The restaurant has a number of spaces around the room that staff move in and out of and the moment one has gone, another takes their place. The second that a plate appears finished, someone swoops in, asks if you enjoyed it and takes it away. The whole thing feels rushed, and there is no opportunity to relax as a member of staff (there seems to be about 8 hovering around in quite a small space) is always on top of you. This is a shame as the food and general atmosphere are good. Also watch out as they add a service charge and leave an additional space for gratuity - makes me question what is the service charge for and does it go to the serving staff.

Also, the final candy course included a truffle with bacon which we couldn't eat and not only did they not have a substitute for it, but I had to ask if we could get something to replace it.

Thanks and we look forward to returning.', 'Service was outstanding! Food tasted delicious! However the 9pz filet I got was cut almost all the way in half. I guess the cook was checking to see how done it was. I ordered it medium rare but the steak varied from medium to well from one side to the other.

We were immediately seated, restaurant was about 80% full. There were a number of tasty sounding cocktail specials, a few of us decided on Cucumber White Linen which we agreed was delicious. Appetizers ordered were on point: Korean BBQ ribs, grilled octopus, & mussels, definitely recommend. For the main dishes, a few of us ordered the halibut special, overall the fish was dry it could have used more sauce. Same went for the salmon dish my husband ordered. The shortrib our friend ordered was delicious. The next time we go back I think we'll try meat dishes. For dessert we had the lemonciello cake, which wasn't overly sweet & was light, very good.

Meh is what comes to mind when I think of my experience here. It is a lovely looking restaurant but that is where the positives ended for me and my dining party of 6. Service was polite but not seasoned by any means. The food was just okay; to sum it up, it was under-seasoned, not the best quality/cuts of meat and fish, and just underwhelming and forgettable. As for prices, most entrees ranged from 20 to 30 dollars a piece, so for that price, I really want an enjoyable food experience. My suggestion is to skip it and keep looking if you want a memorable dining experience.', 'My steak and my granddaughter’s strak for her salad were too tough to chew.

This was our first dining experience outdoors at NYAJs and to be honest the ambiance isn't great.

Offered the dessert menu and waited for 10 minutes before standing up and asking for the dessert menu at the bar and then the same waitress came down and asked if we wanted the dessert menu? A different waitress came down asking our order for more cocktails and we had the sense that she was impatient.

My friends and I had a 6pm reservation and had to wait. We were placed next to the bus & kitchen station upstairs when we requested a window as this was a birthday celebration. NO one acknowledged birthday. We were moved to main floor dining room. A wedding party of 300 was upstairs and on the main floor along with a baby party. We ordered, spring rolls came and tasted like out of a cardboard box! NO full bar. House wine was $15 a glass and awful. Fried Rice came next and then they forgot about us and never brought the 4 other dishes we ordered. There was no apology for the service given or for not bringing our food out. I had to flag down waitstaff for the bill and told them forget about the order as we were starving and had to look for another place to have dinner.

There was a communication barrier with trying to get the people serving the food to bring the rice we ordered, or to fill water or tea. We never got it. We finished and waited, and waited. Finally we flagged down someone to bring the bill. The bill came faster than the meal. The person got my credit card before I could put it down. Of course by then every table was full and the line was out the door. We were surprised that such a highly recommended place had no flavor in their food. The shrimp, scallop, noodle dish was bland. The spareribs were bland. The beef dish was bland. Have had more flavor from Panda Express. Grand Harbor is pretty and elegant (except the bathrooms). Hopefully management can address making the dining experience better, instead of just getting people in and out.', 'It’s a really chaotic process if you don’t speak Chinese. Food when you finally get to order is good and the view is nice but setting is underwhelming like an open underfurnished hotel lobby. They messed up my bill and charged me for food at other tables. It was difficult to understand the explanations. Maybe I was there at an off time.', ""The price of meals here are on the high side. Chinese food shouldn't be $20-30 per plate.

No dessert offered as they might during a normal evening but we recognized the line of people out the door waiting to get in and left quickly. Parking here is always tough. The spaces are too narrow and cars will get dinged. A repainting of parking spot lanes to make them smaller and a valet would make this high class restaurant better.

They're quick and to the point though they never did get our order (twelve dishes) completely correct. They did credit us for a missing dish and didn't charge for a mistaken delivery. Kudos for making us whole. Pricing: Surprisingly affordable given the view. Parking lot: Thieves appear to be targeting tourists in this lot.

She offered us a soup with chicken feet, this did not appeal. The next offer was thick and gelatos with rice and shredded chicken, it was delish! The next cart has buns ours had BBQ pork in it. We also had 2 different types of dumplings and some rice dish. All I can say, if you find yourself with a long layover at SFO, go to Grand Harbor!', 'The food was good. Thought this was a traditional dim sum place but it’s a combination of some items coming around on the cart but most need to be ordered. Once the order was in service was quick.', 'Have heard about this place and even mentioned on Triple D- Guy Fieri and as a foodie, needed to try it. We arrived earlier than our reservation and the host was nice , friendly and sat us down right away. We ordered eggrolls, house special- chicken and seafood, lobster dish (3lbs) , vegetables- green beans. However, from everything we ordered the only thing ok were the eggrolls , green beans and hot tea. All other, it was : hard to eat because we had to be careful with bones and lobster shells that I almost chipped my tooth. Taste for house special was not as it looked on the menu bland and not tasty. As for the lobster, the garlic over powered the lobster. We didn’t even finish all 3lbs. We were disappointed and unfortunately we will not return.', 'Advertised as a Dim Sum place almost none of the Dim Sum was available. Wine was $15.00 a glass. Service weak. Main dish only so so.', 'We met relatives that had a 5 hour layover at SFO. It’s the perfect location for dinner near the airport.

She sent me to the cashier to “check-in” but that just confused more people. Instead of offering an apology, the receptionist kept on saying she didn’t know how I could make a reservation and that’s between the owner of the restaurant and open table. Once seated, service was poor and obviously the restaurant was understaffed. Food was tasteless and greasy. It’s a waterfront restaurant but since were seated so far away from the window, we never got to enjoy the view. Bottomline, never coming back and wish I never did.', 'Good restaurant and great service! Good food', ""Slow service, food takes forever to come out & not sure why, there was ample staff/servers on the floor with deer in the headlights look.

Would eat there again.', ""Besides the view of bay/airport, this was a huge disappointment... we did an OpenTable rez over a week in advance for a dimsum work luncheon ...big mistake not only did we have to wait for 20 min for someone to take our order, but we then had to wait another hour for our dimsum food! (usually dimsum is very fast, they made some excuse about the steam dumplings needed time, but not an hour! Nothing was done to compensate for long wait, no food, no discount, no nice waitstaff... even when we finally go the food it wasn't spectacular, or inexpensive, it definitely wasn't worth the wait/price...plus, we were charged for extra item and also shorted an item *so many better dimsum places, so many better views, esp ocean views on coast, not dirty bay view w airport...will never go there again (have no idea why so many asians go there, cuz its not cheap or great)"", 'We made a reservation based on watching a Diners, Drive In’s & Dives episode where they advertised dumplings. We didn’t realize until we got there that the restaurant had changed owners & when we asked for the dumplings menu (@ dinner) we were informed that they only do dumplings at breakfast. The restaurant was freezing cold & little to no patrons on a Friday night, so we left as our main reason for going was for dumplings...which I might add, was advertised on the outside of the restaurant & on their website.', 'Communication is an issue, have to flag someone down to get water refills and napkins.

A bit noises, but the restaurant was full by 11:30am on s Friday. Great value!', 'Does not matter if we book or not, the dont know how to check and told us we have no reservation', 'Wonderful view. Service and food was good, but nothing spectacular. Go early for dim sum. Gets crowded during lunch hours, even on weekdays.', ""The food system is confusing for a newcomer. Some dishes are brought around so we waited and no one came by. We thought it was that kind of system. We did not realize we needed to mark up the printed menu to order and had to ask how to get food. The food when it arrived was good but as our orders came in more dishes we didn't order came by. The waiter could tell our confusion and explained that what was coming by was not something we had ordered.""]",113

Our server was great but the food was not worth the $200 bill. My salad with steak was $24 and it came as a small side salad with 4 tiny pieces of tough cheap cut steak on it - I actually had to spit most of it out in a napkin I’m embarrassed to say! My husbands Cobb salad came and it was a bowl of mostly chopped romaine with no dressing. finally got some dressing after requesting it. My family members did get a crab cake and some pasta which they loved so maybe they were just off their salad games tonight. They also marked my reservation as a no show even though I checked in!

Server came quickly and took our drink order which came a bit slowly considering we were in the bar and had a couple of draft beers.

We had a 6:00 reservation for 4. Our waiter was very nice, but, he had a hard time hearing us and we kept having to repeat ourselves. We finally got our orders in, had calamari as an app. Really disappointed at the portion, it was barely enough for everyone to get a few pieces. For the price, I would have expected that it would have been ample enough to serve a family of 4. We eat out frequently and I travel for work, it was the smallest, most expensive dish of calamari I'd ever seen. Dinner came, in increments, not all the dishes came at the same time. The last thing to come out was sweet potato fries . . not an item that should've come 10 minutes after the rest of the meal.

We were the only ones when we arrived which wasn't reassuring but we were told it would fill up soon.

I have been to similar wine bar restaurants in Virginia and Maryland and none of them had a cork fee for the wine if bought while dining in, but we were assured it was still less than most restaurant markups. Saw the same wine at Total Wine for $21 versus the $35 dollars we were charged, but they did allow us to choose another wine when the first recommendation was not very good. The food was moderately priced and the crab cake dish and fries were better than average, however the highly recommended lamb chops were pretty bland.

I don’t know how a restaurant like this can still be serving drinks with plastic straws. To make it worse they are also partnering with save the sea and add a £1 donation to your bill. I have messaged the restaurant asking why they still use plastic straws and when they will stop but they have not responded.

Our experience certainly wasn't without fault however. We arrived to be sat at a table in one of the most out of the way spots in the restaurant. We were moved when we asked to be thankfully. This meant a different waiter however who was relatively unfriendly and inattentive and made a quite a few errors with our order (extra sides ordered and incorrect drinks being brought to the table). The food was nice but the vinegar/shallot accompaniment with my oysters just wasn't quite right and my scallop main, althought very tasty, was also really quite small."", 'Food, which was what brought us here, was fantastic at every step.

Our 2 year old daughter loved the Arancini rice balls and we had to re-order it. I loved the Crab ravioli and my husband got the Risotto among a couple of other small bites.

However, the unpersonal service made it a not very pleasurable experience. Although everyone was polite, no one really seem to care about the experience of their customers. I wouldn't make this complaint of many restaurants but when you pay an average of £70 per head, you expect a bit more of professionalism and care rarher than a factory-like service."", 'This was our first visit to Edinburgh and we asked a local couple, we befriended over a year ago, where we should eat for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. They recommended Honours so we made a reservation several weeks in advance. The appetizers and entree were amazing. However, when we ordered our dessert it never came. After waiting quite a long time without a visit from our waiter due to a large group that came in, we asked for our check. The manager explained that our dessert was billed to the wrong table and we could just wait for another dessert. Oddly, there was no real offer to correct the mistake other than to just wait longer. By then the excitement of the meal had worn off so we elected to leave. It was a very disappointing end to a meal that started with great promise. It will be difficult for me to recommend The Honours moving forward simply based on service. I had hoped for something better for such a big occasion for us.', 'Food is good but the place is looking tired and dirty', ""We wanted somewhere for a good quality meal to treat a guest. We hadn't eaten here for a while so thought it would be a good option. The starters were lovely - scallops and rabbit. Mains were a bit disappointing - small portions (especially the roe deer which was more of a starter!). I had guinea fowl which was beautifully cooked. It came with fregola - although I'd told them about my gluten intolerance I was concerned it wasn't gluten free. Unfortunately nobody stopped to check whether everything was OK and it proved too difficult to get anyone's attention so I just pushed the pasta to the side and ate everything else. When I queried it the waiter said it wasn't gluten free! Thankfully the manager came over and confirmed that it was definitely gluten free - a bit of training would have prevented a lot of anxiety! Desserts were very disappointing - generally small and over-sweet. If you have a dish on the menu called Perthshire Strawberries I expect more than 3 of them! At ~ £55 per head for a 3-course meal I expected much better."", 'Fantastic lunch. The restaurant manager sorted us out with a great table where we could park our pram and enjoy the lunch.

I would have liked my dish a little spicier, but not having been there for a while, medium was safe. We had an early reservation (5:30), as one person had to be somewhere else at 7pm. They weren't busy. In fact, we had to wait for them to unlock the door, as the restaurant doesn't open until 5:30. The wait staff seemed hesitant to approach the table; I'm all for them not hanging around, but I also don't expect to have to flag someone down to take my order. This also meant we didn't leave until almost 7. One thing I disliked, was that the staff took the leftovers that were to be packed to go, back into the kitchen.

We were happy with the selection of food but we all felt that the main - after 3 appetizers was too large. Luckily our two LARGE husbands were able to help us with the quantity of food.

The vibe in the restaurant is great with music playing and a urban modern look and is bigger than we envisaged. The portions are large but it would be nice to see people with smaller appetites catered for as I couldn't manage a 10oz steak. There is quite a good variety of choice even though its a steak restaurant. I had the Chicken and avocado salad which was lovely. There weren't loads of choices for dessert but after eating such a large meal many wouldnt have room for a dessert! The staff were all very friendly and pleasant.

However, when the food came my steak I couldn’t even cut with a steak knife and it was inedible. The waitress kindly took it away and said she will get me a new one, couldn’t complain about that! Then a man who seated us came back over to the table with the plate and asked what he was meant to do with it, I explained I can’t eat it and he tried to justify why it was chewy and said because I had it med/well. Then said that my new steak will be a while as the chef has to cook it from scratch! I have never had that in a restaurant before and I certainly won’t go back, if the food isn’t up to the standard your paying then you shouldn’t have to argue why your sending it back.', 'Was in there for almost 2 hours, took an hour for a starters to arrive, then another 40 mins for our mains to arrive, they forgot all of our extras and didn’t even get a sorry or anything, just questioned everything, Poor food, poor timing, overall POOR', 'this was our first time at Black Rock and I would definatly recommend it,the food was fantastic with very large helpings,we had three courses and all were very good.The staff were very polite and friendly ,we will be going again.', 'Always good as usual.

The manager (lady) had an attitude, and she seemed to think we should care about their plight of having to serve us lowly paying customers. I think their food is good judging by other reviews since we never got to the entrees. Mistakes do happen I get it, but they seem unprepared to deal with their mistakes.

The drink selection is excellent! They have a lot of Indian beers, as well as the usual fare if you aren’t feeling adventurous. The food is exceptional.

There's never a negative when we eat at 1947. I have to add a negative comment to my previous review. The manager has not acknowledged our reservation so we are denied our points for this visit. I don't know why this has happened because we definitely checked in when we were there. I'm going to call once again--I've called before.

The owners took the effort to personally attend to all the customers. Food quality and quantity was really good with reasonable prices. The menu had unique dishes (both appetizers and desserts) that reflected the 'Hyderabadi cuisine'. Menu is largely continental (no south-indian dishes inspite of the name suggesting a typically south-indian fare). There is room for improvement in the decor and ambiance to qualify the overall experience as 'fine dining', but I would surely recommend it as an above-average restaurant for both couples, families and large groups (they have an adjoining party hall accomodating 70 people).

We waited for an hour for our food to be served and we were not willing to continue to wait as it was pretty late. It hurt to pay lots of money for poor quality food. We were expecting so much more. We know mistakes can happen, however you would expect management to have handled it differently. The waitress gave the excuse that they had a large party that took long for her to serve. This shouldn’t be any customers problem, especially since the restaurant was nowhere near full. Furthermore, bathrooms are not well kept. Truly disappointed in the overall experience.', 'Very disapointed this year. Short on staff.... poor plates placement at the buffet service.. plates were cold as ice. The turkey was barely warm and terribly greasy even the white breat meat was nothing special.... love the shrimp and large scallops dedicated table with a person doing the cooking on the spot. They put a stinko customer near us so we requested table change. Many notted the poor judgment call for this custmer...disapointment and really not worth the slow service and disapointing food but nice desert althought some come from freezer as it turns out such as the pecan pie!!... will not attempt this venue again. A refund would be warranted at best.

Food appeared in good time... food could have been hotter but scallops were excellent... we ordered them as a main... 6 rather than 3 Plates were cleared... dessert menus presented and to our dismay there were 3 spelling errors... absolutely not acceptable at the Fairmont Chateau... it was pointed out... Tracey said the Manager had it proof read 3 times.... seems a lot of people cannot spell!!!! We ordered a dessert to share and I was also given a small flourless chocolate cake to atone for the spelling errors.. nice touch .

We looked for bagels to go with the smoked salmon and accompaniments. Cold salads were not anything we might not see at a local Farm Boy (grocery) salad bar. Better pastries many other places in towns. Scones were dry. Desserts cakes/tortes were all on the (too) rich side.

We chose the buffet, which was ridiculously overpriced ($49) for the quality of the food - for example, the ‘hot’ food was lukewarm at best (cold waffles and pasta are not good). The variety was a positive, at least. The $7 ‘fresh squeezed orange juice’ seemed like it was freshly poured out of a Tropicana box. The server we had was inattentive and at times rude. For example, while we were still placing our orders for drinks she began to walk away. After bringing us our beverages, she did not inquire whether refills were necessary. We would not choose to go back to this restaurant, for the buffet or anything else.', 'Nice ambiance, excellent food and service.

The waiter did not know and it took him some time before he came back to tell us only buffet and the restaurant was trying something new. In our opinion this failed miserably. We did decide to give it a try big mistake. We sat close to the buffet tables. We noticed that the dessert table has no sneeze guard over it and that not all desserts had tongs and it was difficult to get the tarts off the plate with a lifter. There were two little children unsupervised at this table and it was not a pretty sight. We were glad we had gone earlier to this table.

Food came out 30 min late, which I tried to understand because it\'s lunch time. Food came out, appetizer mushroom tangsoo looked different from previous mushroom tangsoo I had. Sauce did not contain starch, it seemed like a heated up Soo Jung Gwa. Second, my cold noodle soup tasted like melted ice and noodle was all overcooked. I\'ve had this menu for so many times so I knew that something was wrong. However, I didn\'t raise the issue until manager lady came and asked how the food was.

Then we waited for another 20 minutes for our server to come back and ask if we needed our checks. and then waited again for her to come to collect them and forever to come back with the cards/change. I was so disappointed with how slow the serve was.', ""I don't get downtown much to eat so I guess $17.50 for a hamburger is par for the course. The burger was nothing special and I expected better.

My wife and I routinely come here to celebrate specific anniversaries because the service, food, and ambience are outstanding.', 'We came out for restaurant week and Bellissimo didn’t disappoint. I had the arugula and beet salad that was excellent and my wife had sausage and beans that were equally as good. We both ordered the veal porcini and thought it was really good. They serve the veal thin cut into medallions and topped with lots of mushrooms, onions and Demi glaze. I finished with the meal with cheesecake for dessert. A very good meal, I would recommend going here for lunch or dinner.', ""Restaurant week - what a bargain! Good service. The recommended house Montepulcianno ($35/bottle), was very nice. The persons ordering lamb shanks liked them a lot! My pasta with salmon and peas was bland and needed salt and seasoning. But I'm the one who ordered a nondescript dish. The olive oil served with bread and Parmesan was pale yellow with little flavor - I like spicy ones. We had a wonderful table in private alcove for four people although we had reserved a table online to sit outside.

First it was great just to find a place that wasn’t part of a chain. All tables were outside—ours was on the sidewalk out front and they had more around the corner carved out from the street. We were greeted by a very efficient runner who not only gave us our setups but offered us each a squirt of hand sanitizer—very nice touch. Every morsel of food was out of this world, from the freshly baked bread served with olive oil and Parmesan. Our apps were a ‘tower’ of tomato and mozzarella with basil. My wife has a pet peeve of being served cold tomatoes and these were perfectly room temperature. I had grilled squid on polenta with the most savory sauce—so much better than the usual fried calamari. My wife had delicious crab-stuffed ravioli in a lobster sauce that, to her delight, were served with a few shrimp as well. Delicious. I had the linguini with scallops and shrimp—perfect sauce, perfect portion—beautiful and so tasty. Even the house bottle of Montepulciano was great for $35. A cannoli for my wife and strawberries sabayon for me—perfected to a great meal. We’ll be back!', 'One of our favorite restaurants. Food is always amazing and the service is outstanding!', 'Good outside table on Main St.', ""We went to Bellissimo for a birthday event and everybody from the party was talking about how great the service and the food were. The staff was friendly, handled our party's needs without any issues, and even gave the birthday guest a special surprise that will be remembered. My only complaint is that I wish there was more on my plate because finishing my meal felt like finishing a really good tv show... You only want more. We will be coming back in the future because now we must try the other items on the menu!"", 'Our meal was decent but nothing spectacular. We were a group of 6 on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was not even half full. Chicken Marsala was the best of the meals I tried. My husband’s lobster bisque had shrimp in it instead of lobster. One of our friends didn’t get the right dinner but settled for what they brought to not have to wait. Cheesecake may have been the tiniest slice of cheesecake I’ve seen. For the food and service, I would go back to Dolce Vita over Bellisimo in the future.', ""Bellissimo was a fantastic experience. The staff was incredibly warm and welcoming. They were very helpful in explaining the menu and in providing recommendations. They had a great and very manageable wine selection. The food was excellent. I strongly recommend doing the gastronomic menu. The chef did a great job providing a variety of tastes and we tried things we definitely wouldn't have ordered (and we loved it). The sidewalk seating is very authentically European. My wife and I cannot wait to go back and we are looking forward to taking our friends and family to our new favorite Italian place!"", 'Took advantage of good weather for outside table on Main St.', 'We were the only diners for most of the experience, and the service was friendly and fine, except that we were seated next to a noisy portable dehumidifier - a strange choice for an empty restaurant. But the real issue was that we found the food sub-par - tough, rubbery chicken with too little of the promised sausage that would have made the dish interesting; a mozzarella/tomato tower that was too cold, lacking in (wilted) basil, and not even made with fresh mozzarella; a small serving of lackluster Costco-like bread, and no cracked pepper for the table. Even the cannoli - my favorite! - was lacking the signature mini chocolate chips that would have made it tasty. The wine list was just OK, yet priced as though it were special. We paid a lot to break our COVID eat-in streak at Bellissimo, then looked at each other saying, \\""We could have done better at home!\\', ""This place was fantastic and the food was amazing, can't wait to go back!"", 'Had a wonderful time, I hope they can make it through COVID. We went and sat in the outside tables for our Anniversary. Great service, everyone was very good at their COVID protections, and the food was delicious!', ""Every dish that we tried was GOOD but it wasn't interesting or exciting. To be entirely fair I went during Restaurant Week so by definition they picked a smaller, universally appealing subset of their menu to mass produce and I knew that was what I was choosing, but that's what it tasted and felt like. Our server was excellent and gave the experience a more elegant feel. He gave me a good wine recommendation and didn't just try to upsell me which I appreciated. He was very attentive and the courses all came out with a well-time rhythm (I'm a slow eater so this is worth mentioning to me!) so you could see that he was attentive and experienced."", 'Except dessert, the overall lunch menu for restaurant week was good. 3-course for $22 is worth not much complaint.', 'pleasant meal, sat outside which is on the street--very noisy', 'Food was great!', 'The mashed potatoes had clearly been plated well before my fish was done as they were cold. Literally, the bites of potatoes and broccoli touching the plate were cold. My husband’s veal was tough. For approximately $35/entree We could have eaten so much better elsewhere. Service was friendly and attentive but we will definitely not be back.', 'My significant other and I dined for the second time at Bellissimo recently. The décor does not wow because the carpet is old and tattered, the placement of dark hardwood floors would be amazing and make the restaurant look refined along with a few other things. Otherwise, there were a few stumbles but this experience was definitely better than the first visit. My significant other ordered the following for his three course meal: Fried Calamari, Lamb Shank with noodles and vegetables, and cheesecake. I ordered the following for my three course meal: Caesar salad, crab ravioli with lobster sauce topped with two pieces of shrimp, and tiramisu. We received bread for the table that was slightly warm and served with an olive oil cheese dip. It was okay but would have been better served fresh and hot with soft butter. My significant other and I shared appetizers, both were good. I am not crazy about lamb, but I tasted his entrée and it was okay. The noodles with the sauce were really tasty. My S.O. loved the lamb and ate every bite of it. His cheesecake was good. My crabmeat ravioli was fine but the lobster sauce was absolutely fabulous.', 'Had the lamb shank and all of the pieces were fatty with little meat on them for around $40. They didnt have the wine they recommended. The food was subpar for how expensive it was.', 'Outdoor dining was a great option.', 'Food was excellent and of great value. We will go back!', 'Went for date night. Staff was very attentive and quick. Food was delicious. Social distancing was done well and temperature checks were done before being seated.

Went back with friends for restaurant week. 3 course menu had nice variety and all of our meals were very good. Appropriate social distancing in place and did not interfere with service or quality. All were in agreement to return again.', 'Noise level is only based on outdoor seating and traffic - not a complaint at all (thanks for having it available!!)

Unfortunately, the patio is situated so that tables get direct sun in the evening as the sun goes down, and I wasn’t prepared with sunscreen. Our waiter wasn’t great this time, and we had to wait a long time to get our check. I intentionally avoid using my phone at the dinner table, so ordering from the website menu was a big turn-off for me. In short, maybe come after the sun has gone down, for brunch, or order to go.

It wreaked of below mediocrity. She did not ask us for an appetizer order and went straight into the entree order and rushed us during the entire ordering process. She did not seem care about her tables. She acted like she wanted them to leave right away and she pressured them to do so.

Our waiter was MIA, so we had to wait before eating (steak, so couldn’t eat without a fork). Absolutely awful experience. Will not go back anytime soon.

The food was WAY over priced and wasn’t good. There was also a very limited menu (4 options for a entree) and that would have been fine but when I called to see if they were open I was told full menu. We spent $55 for 1 appetizer and 2 drinks (I did get the souvenir cup) but still. The food was cold and very dry.

With that, I will never return to the Baltimore HRC. The family near us left the area trashed - food and debris all over the floor, chairs, and table. It was left this way for more than half our meal, watching staff and customers step through it. Our drinks (tropical margaritas) tasted so strongly of lime juice they weren't palatable, on top of the fact they took 20 minutes to arrive. Our food arrived before they managed to bring out our replacement drinks (bottled beer), and was both overcooked and bland. When we requested to speak to the manager it took asking 3 different wait staff to finally get her attention. She was passive aggressive, argumentative, and petty. She comped our entire meal simply to prove a point - which was fine considering it wasn't a meal worth the price anyhow - but it was not done out of good customer service. All in all I suggest you not only avoid this place, but you should probably just avoid Baltimore altogether. This experience wasn't unique"", 'The Hard Rock Cafe is just not like I remember it to be and with the restrictions mandated its just not the same vibe.

That was not the issue. The hostess did not wear her mask properly, with it hanging beneath her nose, and she got so close when speaking to you that it made me uncomfortable. Her unkempt appearance was not suitable for for a hostess. I almost cancelled my reservation because of her appearance and poor customer service. The service we received from our server was poor. Even after hinting that we tip well for great service he still failed, on several occasions, to provide is what we requested (more water, a cup for our beer, ketchup).

After a quick temperature scan we were promptly seated. The food was very good and service was excellent! I would suggest asking for a large beverage though as everything is served in rather small plastic cups and we did eventually see a slightly larger cup served.

I understand that it is COVID times but there weren’t many people there except another pair. She just seemed very overwhelmed.

The patio itself is nice, but I think it would be fair to mention while making a reservations which part of it you’re able to book. To be honest I made a reservation in this restaurant based mostly on patio view, so to be seated on the other side was very disappointing. The food wasn’t anything crazy.

Outdoor seating w/ good social distancing. The bartender Raoul made the spicy margarita I love even though it was not on the menu. The food was very good at this casual eatery though the selection was not their usual yet. As always, the service was excellent. Really glad to be able to come here again!"", ""Overall, we had a positive experience. The staff were great - very friendly, hospitable and quick. The food is average, but one thing that really stands out is the boneless chicken wings on the appetizer menu. Get those and some fries for dinner, and you won't be sorry. I often try something different when we go there, but nothing ever beats the boneless wings! This was our first dining experience outdoors at NYAJs and to be honest the ambiance isn't great. It's right next to two fairly busy roads and the only thing helping with the traffic noise is the fact that the seating area is surrounded by a berm. It's not a deal killer, but there might be better spots for a date. We've been inside plenty of times and that has a nice feel to it."", 'Hot day when the sun swings around, but overall good setup on the Patio and close to the restrooms when you need to go indoors.

The furniture, the shade opportunites, consideration of climate considerations (fans) leaves a lot to be desired. There is no reason the entire outside dining area cannot be covered rather than a few umbrellas. The outdoor furniture was generally uncomfortable. Avery was our server and was terrific. From pizzas to sandwiches, the food was very good. Until they upgrade their outside dining I would not recommend the patio, but the food and service were quite good.', 'We were greeted by a very nice hostess and brought to our table. Our waiter was probably the most bland and impersonal waiter we’ve ever had. No emotion, monotone, and seemed as if he didn’t want to wait on our table.

Important to keep this restaurant viable because their lunch and happy hour crowd are not at work in surrounding offices, so patronage is very weak. Please visit and dine there.', 'Our waiter was outstanding. Great place to enjoy a meal.', ""Our Father's Day dinner started out good with the exception of a few things. - Our server asked to approach our table which we all thought to give us our menus. He was way overly friendly to the point that he was way too close to our personal space and he continually leaned our table to talk with us. - Due to the VA rules of COVID, Face Mask we're not a priority with management. As new customers walked through the door they disregarded the mask signs posted. - Seating needed to be priority. We were seating in high traffic area which I should have said something. During our dinner a family walked in without mask and were seated approx. three feet from our booth. If restaurants want to serve guest, management needs to be more aware of all the Covid guidelines both with customers and their staff."", ""Food was excellent as always, but the service was a little slower that I would have expected given the restaurant had a very small number of people in it on a Wednesday night. Also we let them know in advance that it was my wife's birthday and not a mention of it the whole evening. Finally I had to tell the waiter so they would bring a candle on her dessert. What is the point of entering information like that on the reservation if they are not going to pay attention to it?"", 'When I made a 6:45 pm reservation I had no idea the restaurant closed at 8:00 pm. We were completely rushed through our meal. In addition, the menu is so limited, it’s almost not worth going out to eat if you’re expecting a good dining experience. I will continue to patronize to help keep restaurants in business, but next time I’ll probably do take-out.', 'Outstanding food and service. I was blown away by the simple Super Crunch Salad with chicken which was delicious. Chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly!!

When we arrived our server told us that the kitchen closes in 15 minutes. I was not aware at the time of making the reservation that the restaurant closed at 8pm. The server was nice about it, but that is not a great experience to be rushed.', ""Our outdoor dining experience during the Covid-19 reopening was poor. Although there were seats in the shade, we were seated half in the sun. It was uncomfortably hot. Our waiter was not good. He wasted a lot of time and the people with the other server who came in after us by 10 minutes got their food before us. The people next to us were chided for moving one of their chairs to see each other better. Apparently, a breach of social distancing, NYAJ's didn't handle the problem well - scolding them. Then, we left cash and got tracked down as we left. We were scolded and told they only accept credit cards because of the pandemic. Money is filthy, we were told. (Really, it's not as filthy at the grocery or the drug store?) Then, the waiter handled my card with the same gloves on he used to serve food, pick up dirty dishes, etc. Um...total fail."", 'We ate outside and I felt quite safe, good social distance, staff all followed covid requirements and food was very good.', 'Our visit was average with the exception of our waiter. He informed us, almost from the beginning, that he “was still hung over.” He didn’t seem to care anything about what we wanted, and he never made contact. At one point, I asked him a question, and it caused my friend to “please stop being so rude.” He never once made eye contact or apologized. His appearance was one of someone who may very well been wearing the same clothes he had on the night before. Both my friend and I have been t this establishment many times, and this not the kind of person you want representing your company.', 'They had their same great menu and they took safety seriously. Bravo.', 'Awesome Food and Exceptional Service. There were very few people inside - most on the patio.', ""I normally really like Not Your Average Joe's, especially the location in Rockville. However the food was not good at this location (admittedly it was a limited menu because of COVID).

Das Essen war insgesamt zu teuer.', 'We have come here continuously for the past 5 years and have always loved it. The service as well as the food were very average and the price (€190 for two with Aperitif and wine) was exorbitant for what we received. The chicken was bitter and served in a slimy lemon sauce.

Otherwise, plenty of nice options along Paul-Lincke-Ufer.', 'Toller Abend mit Freunden. Die Location ist wunderschön und lädt zum Verweilen ein. Service sehr gut: freundlich, aufmerksam und schnell.

Dafür lohnt es sich nicht sonntags auswärts zu frühstücken: Stulle mit Ei, wenn auch schmackhaft mit den Beilagen, aber es war wirklich nicht das, was wir unter Brunch vestehen.

I felt like the regular chef must have had the night off and someone not up to par filled in. I had mentioned in my Open Table reservation that we had a wheelchair in the party yet when we arrived, they seemed surprised by it. The wait staff also seemed to be “in training”. Had to run get a Specials list when asked what the Catch of the Day was, asked us if we were still working on our dinners when it was obvious our plates were half full, etc. We’ve had many successful lunches here and don’t often come for dinner.

This made for a stressful meal for me and my family.', 'Excellent food service and atmosphere. Can not wait to try the outside seating when it gets warmer out.', 'The appetizers were frozen and microwaved. Had to send back 2 drinks because the bartender did not know how to mix drinks. They sat us in a busy waiter hallway with constant interruptions. The noise was ridiculously loud. Had to scream across the table. After everything was said and done we had 2 appetizers and 2 cocktails and it cost us $60. Not sure how the main course dishes taste and are prepared but did not want to take the chance. Good luck.', 'I knew certain restaurants were without power on August 7th but they were kind enough to post it on their webpage.

We'd visited this restaurant several years ago for our anniversary and decided to make a reservation for a belated Valentine's dinner. The only problem with making it two days after Valentine's was that they'd run out of many items on their menu so their menu was more limited. I was really looking forward to some escargot! The only hiccup with this visit was that we had to wait 10 to 15 minutes to get a menu. They promptly filled our water and took our drink orders but after not receiving the menu, we asked for one. Other than that, the service was attentive and excellent. The food was great. My husband had Salmon Wellington and I had Lamb Shank. For dessert we had the sampler platter which I highly recommend!

What was intended as an off-the-cuff date night turned out to be a lovely experience in which we were fawned over and made to feel at home. The outdoor seating area, while temporarily set in an adjacent parking lot, was filled with plants and very quiet and pleasant. We were abundantly distanced from other diners and felt very safe. The food was very nice and well presented, but the standout was clearly the host. He stopped by frequently to check in and chat, but was never overbearing or unpleasant. His warmth and friendliness instead seemed like that of a host at a little town restaurant in Europe. We will return soon!', 'Cafe Renaissance is truly a neighborhood gem. Although unassuming on the outside in a suburban strip mall, on the inside it is intimate, elegant and quiet. The food is superb, primarily French and with an emphasis on fish and seafood. The prices are in line with up market restaurants in the DC area with entrees between $30-40 but worth it. We go there mostly for special nights out.', 'Spent a date night here and it was an amazing experience! Highly recommend for anyone. The owner greeted us very well with warm welcome.

As expected, it is expensive and a splurge. The service is impeccable but I gave it 3 stars for service because I asked for a table by the window and was not given one. As we were seated, 2 window tables opened up, both of which remained open for over an hour, so I am not sure why my request was not granted. Our table for 2 was in the middle part of the restaurant with lots of traffic going back and forth that did significantly diminish the experience.

The only reason I gave food a 4 star is because we received the wrong dish but it was still delicious and we ate it.

Especially great was the extensive gluten free menu for one person in our group. Margaritas too, were delicious. Both, on the rocks and frozen, in particular the passion fruit margarita. The large size was huge and pretty good value. At $18, less than double the price of the small but what looked like more than three times the volume.

The menu was good and the food excellent. It’s a sharing menu, though, so it’s not my preference for a business dinner. I love the idea when I’m just out with my husband, but not as much when it’s business or friends who aren’t as close. We had the oysters and the mignonette was superb. We had a steak - it had a really nice reduction on the side. We had the Brussels sprouts - they were excellent. And the cocktails were well done. The service was good, the server was friendly but not over the top, and left us alone while we chatted. Bonus: she didn’t ask us what our plans are for the rest of the night like servers always do these days. That is to say, she wasn’t phoney-friendly at the end when she brought the bill. Bravo!

But, all in all, we enjoyed ourselves very much!!!"", 'We have been to Hawthorne several times and we usually love the food. This time the service was amazing. The food was not the usual standard. However we were also disappointed to see that management allowed for a very large party (larger than 6) to occupy multiple tables and to basically have a party. The group was also very loud and ruined our experience. We cut our dinner short because we didn’t want to be in this environment.', 'We arrived and waited over 35 minutes for beverages and then decided to leave. Never have been to establishment and left before. Not sure if they were under staffed or just didn’t want to serve us. Went to Charcut up the street and had amazing service and dinner! Don’t waste your time here. We are usually a huge fan of Fairmont properties however this was a huge disappointment.', 'This was the best restaurant experience I have ever had. I made a reservation for my partner and me for our seventh anniversary, and Hawthorne made it so special. From the moment we arrived, they welcomed us and showed us to a very intimate, unique table. Initially, when I had made the booking, it looked like there were no tables left - only bar seats - so I put a note in my reservation asking for \\""a more intimate seat, if possible.\\"" They sat us in the dining area, which was closed at the time of our arrival - so that we could get the best seat in the restaurant! The servers all wished us a happy anniversary and even brought us a delicious dessert with sparklers for FREE because of our special occasion.

The hostesses were kind enough to let us know upon arriving they they were “very” busy and we could only stay for two hours. Thanks Regina George. 2. We were seated for a 5:45 dining time immediately next to another table while there were a plethora of open tables nearby. After asking to be relocated, our request was granted under duress. 3.

Chef does a fantastic job. Need the Oak Room ambiance to return.', 'Great service and ambience. Lamb main dish had wonderful flavour. More care should be given to how meat is cut. Only meat should be served. New York steak was spectacular. Dacquoise disappointing. Bread should be replaced with Genoise or at least soaked in liquor or fruit juice. Too dry.

Our waiter (Joesph) was excellent... when he was there. Slowest service ever! When we were seated, it took 10 min for him to come to greet us. After the drink order was taken it took 15 min to arrive. Once our dinner order was taken and after we had finished eating, not once did he check in on us. It actually took 25 min after we were finished until a manager walked over to ask if she could clear our table, which is when I asked for our bill and expressed my displeasure for the service.

Price was WAY to expensive for what I received especially after spending 600 dollars on the room already then 220 dollars do mediocre food."", 'The service was very good however we were disappointed with our food.

The manager did say that he could give us a free round of drinks either seat us inside (which was not an option for us and the whole reason we made the outdoor reservation in the first place) or we\'d have to wait at least 30 minutes (and probably longer since there were only a few outdoor tables). Since there was no telling how long we would actually have to wait, we left to find another place to eat.

Loved it', 'Everything was excellent. Our homemade ravioli appetizer, our Caesar Salad, my Husbands Veal dish... All Delicious. However, the one reason I go back and back is because their lasagna rivaled that of Florence. It was a Ragu and Béchamel layered base. Tonight’s lasagna dinner was 98% red sauce. Not Florence style anymore. I mean Béchamel is cheap to make... Flour, butter, milk, nutmeg, white pepper, salt... I was disappointed in the lasagna tonight. This is the only Old School restaurant you can go to in this area that make their pasta from scratch and does a béchamel/ragu lasagna. I only hope they go back to their old way. On the side, the service is excellent. Cocktails on point!', 'This restaurant has always been our favorite. It has been a great place to dine since they opened their doors. Over the years it’s gotten better. Quality and service are phenomenal.', 'We recently had our first meal inside - there was ample distancing, the staff was super attentive, and they even offered to do a half and half meal when I was trying to decide which main dish to order. everything is so very nice there. It is authentic Italian, family run, and part of the neighborhood while being a treat at the same time! We also ordered out for a group of people to have a distanced dinner in our backyard a while back and that was fantastic too! Love this place.', 'So happy they are open again. Friendly service and great pasta. Loved the tapenade.', 'Friendly atmosphere, outstanding service and the food is served hot and nothing is over cooked, including the vegetables. This is one of the best restaurants in northern Virginia.', ""Landini's in Old Town is so so much better.

The food was incredible!', ""Absolutely loved the food, the staff, the service, and the environment. The downside was the noise during our visit. We were looking for a quiet engagement celebration so we booked late into the evening. When we arrived there was a party of 8 with four small children that were extremely loud to the point we couldn't hear ourselves over them. This persisted for our entire visit and we ended it early without dessert or finishing our meals to move to a quieter venue.

My only complaint would be that our wine was in an ice bucket not within reach of the table which I don’t like. Superb outdoor terrace too.', 'The food and individual service were very good. My only concern was how busy the restaurant was. Every table was full and the room felt crowded. In the main restaurant there were just as many tables as before vivid restrictions.

Cocktails were fab and the atmosphere is lovely.', 'We had the NYE set menu at £70pp. We absolutely love Japanese food and have eaten at many restaurants so were very disappointed with the menu selection which felt like it had been chosen to cater for people who don’t like authentic Japanese food. Duck spring rolls, fried chicken and skewers - these aren’t the foods that come to mind when one thinks of Japanese cuisine. The bao buns were stale as they had clearly been premade, the duck spring rolls were seemingly just duck with no additional seasoning other than the sauce served on the side. Unfortunately this was the most disappointing meal we have ever eaten at a Japanese restaurant and certainly not worth the price. That being said, the service was fantastic and all the staff were so attentive and friendly. The drinks selection was great and the cocktails were delicious. The restaurant itself has a great vibe without being so noisy that you can’t enjoy a conversation. In this case perhaps it was the nature of it being New Years Eve and a set menu that let our experience down.', ""The food is really delicious and the restaurant is very beautiful. We were there on a Tuesday night in January, so the place was very quiet. However, we never felt like we were being rushed out and the service was attentive and friendly. It's the cheapest night out but worth it for a special treat."", 'Great service and great food!

Also, it\'s still a comfortable and relatively casual place. A local gem!', 'Shrimp were tough, undercooked.', 'This place is really cute! The owner was there, and he’s a super nice guy. The food is interesting, good but definitely a little experimental which leaves some items to be hit or miss. I like that though, because they’re having fun with the menu.

Definitely will be stopping by here more now that I know that it’s there!', 'Great last minute choice for a venue for a business dinner. Our first-time out of town guest was pleasantly surprised with the wine selections (and prices for the wine). Vouvray and Tempranillo pairings with our food choices of lamb with parsnip chips (there were prepared with just the right amount of crisp) and duck that was cooked to perfection served with the surprise of a foie gras ice cream.

Menu and wine pairing are out of this world.', ""Had noticed this site many times and since it had such great reviews we decided to check it out. We were the only ones when we arrived which wasn't reassuring but we were told it would fill up soon. It appeared to be a neighborhood spot as others arrived for dinner later in the evening and seemed to know each other. I have been to similar wine bar restaurants in Virginia and Maryland and none of them had a cork fee for the wine if bought while dining in, but we were assured it was still less than most restaurant markups. Saw the same wine at Total Wine for $21 versus the $35 dollars we were charged, but they did allow us to choose another wine when the first recommendation was not very good. The food was moderately priced and the crab cake dish and fries were better than average, however the highly recommended lamb chops were pretty bland. It could have just been an off night for the kitchen since the majority of the reviews I had read were favorable. Sure it is a great place for locals but I would not make the drive again."", 'Party of six to celebrate my mother’s birthday. The service was excellent - our super professional and relaxed server never wrote a single thing down even through there was a lot of back and forth while ordering (impressive!). My husband had a beef rib that the chef had been working on since 3am and he says it was the best he’d ever had. All meals were delicious and we left very satisfied.

I had the rosette of lamb, dauphinoise potatoes and the G&T glazed lemon tart.

I overheard another server telling a table about it, which is how I came to find out about it. Ordered a pizza to go for when we left as well, only to find out when it was time for the bill that it wasn’t started yet - we had to ask if it needed to be cooked still, as I think the server would have attempted to swiftly go back to get the order in. We were charged for it but had it taken off which was fine. Ordered a side salad instead of fries for my burger, but I got fries. Then they brought out a full salad which we ended up being charged for. We didn’t draw attention to the fact that we were charged for a salad I had ordered as a side, and just paid for it. To be clear, I ate the fries that were sent out instead of drawing attention to the fact that it was not a salad out of niceness to not bother the server.

A friend and I wanted to go to provide a bit of support in this difficult time. We had the chef’s tasting menu with a couple of offered upgrades. Started with cocktails and then had a bottle of wine. Three dishes arrived at once. Hardly Michelin-style service. They were fine, maybe a little better than fine, but the simultaneous delivery meant we consumed them much differently than chef had intended. Then nothing. For 40 minutes. We were enjoying a decent $160 bottle of wine suggested by one of our servers. Our meal came to a close after 3 hours and 30 minutes. It was a long meal and not in a great way. The check was $700 - a real eye opener for sure. We added the tip and then realized 20% was already included. Hadn’t noticed since the usual detailed sheet wasn’t provided.

Really enjoyed the food and service!', 'In these circumstances Elements has done an amazing job of high class delivery of food. The menu provides one vegetarian and two other choices and includes an appetizer course, typically a dip with crudités, a salad course, bread with rich butter, vegetable seasoned and cooked perfectly, the main course with one or two accompaniments, and followed by dessert. Everything is packaged appropriately for heating or serving. This varied, expertly prepared menu is a bargain at $49, or $39 for vegetarian option. Several add ons are offered, including home made pasta with a choice of sauces, breads, and 2-3 side dishes. Having tried everything on the menu, any choice will be a good one. I hope and pray that the delivery business will soon transform to the old full service sit down service, but until then, the menu must be experienced repeatedly.

I am sure to be back!', 'Prior to our meal I was told the birthday girl would receive a special card and that did not happen. Food was fine. We were happy with the seating, wine tasting, and accommodations for non mushroom eaters.', 'Amazing social distancing with dividers between tables for the outdoor dining and there weren’t people walking between or around the tables. All servers were masked and gloved. This was a belated Mother’s Day for my mother in law - she is more comfortable speaking Spanish so they had a waitress who spoke Spanish for our table!

The menu looked like good but only two plat (Tuna and dessert) were good and on the right level of this restaurant. The service was poor and we waited until 20 minutes between two plats. We waited for the wine also and nobody took care of us. The quality was completely bad and not like a fine restaurant. We were completely disappointed by this place and we don’t recommend it.

They handle the outdoor dinning mandate superbly. We had a privately tented table for 4. The food, related wine pairing and service was excellent. We will definitely return in the future.', 'We had the 5 course tasting menu and loved it! An awesome evening amazing food atmosphere and staff!', ""We have dined at this restaurant countless times since it initially opened on Bayard Lane years ago. The service continues to be exceptional and its the closest you can come to a NYC level fine dining experience in the downtown Princeton area. However, I'm just not sure its worth the high cost of admission anymore. On the plus side, we applaud the kitchen's embrace of spicier notes which were historically lacking (Japanese Squid and the Scallops) and the Farmer's Cheese Ice Cream with Melon was delicious. The Ribeye (main and final dish pre-dessert) was a bit under for our palate and on the cold side. On the minus side, we wish they could have honored the outside dining request we made for our anniversary and re-confirmed in advance. Unexpectedly being a guinea pig the first weekend of indoor dining post covid quarantine took away from the experience (though the interior conditions were impeccable, spacing well done and staff impeccable as always). Add to that an almost 3 hour grind to get through just 5 courses overall (did I mention they forgot the oyster supplement we ordered, thank goodness). Our most memorable tastings (both here and away) involved eager anticipation for"", 'Went for our Anniversary and they really made it special. The ambiance, the food, the wine and the service was amazing. For Father’s Day we ordered the pre-cooked bbq dinner for 4 it was superb. All we did was follow the chef’s written instructions basically warm on the grill. If you are looking for a superb fine dining experience I highly recommend Elements in Princeton.']",1798

It had been awhile since the pandemic and everything closed down for a few months. Upon arrival, it was a beautiful sunny day, and we made reservations through Open Table on the spot. We walked in and we were served within minutes. The hostess asked us questions pertaining to Covid-19 and we were seated right after outside. I don’t remember their seating being so comfortable. We scanned the barcode for the menu which I liked. We were there for lunch, and wanted to share something. We decided on the 7 layer burrito with a salad on the side and the charcoal lemonade. At first we were going to try the nachos but Fresh’s wraps are huge and filling so we opted for the burrito. Our host was super cool and very friendly!

For the past couple of weeks that we had lunch at Fresh on Crawford, we noticed our main courses (Tiger bowl and Protein Bowl) were not as tasty as they used be.

We are regular customers at this Fresh location. I’m disappointed that a very reasonable request couldn’t be granted.

Our GF daughter received her dinner from the server which is a huge NO NO at 110 Grill, all allergen dinners are served by a manager. And usually marked. Our dinners were cold when served. We sent them back and received them back and they were still cold. We just decided to eat them. We didnt have a very kind server and we seemed to be bugging her all night by merely being there so it wasn't worth the effort.

They told me that you should eat this stuff for 3 weeks to completely re-train your taste buds and start craving it. To me, it is not about not eating animal proteins, it is about the taste - having salt, pepper and hot sauce on the table so customers can make their food more palatable themselves is not really a solution - more of a deonstration of a problem.

It was full of Kale, hard boiled eggs, and other things I don't typically associate w/ a Caesar Salad. If it hadn't been called Caesar Salad, I wouldn't have been as put-off by it. I never read the description for something basic like that, as every other time I've ever ordered a Caesar Salad anywhere else, they've generally been pretty similar...romaine lettuce, croutons, Caesar dressing, and usually some fresh parmesan cheese on top. My salmon was pretty tasty."", 'The food was good, but very pricey. Super noisy. Can’t say that will recommend or go back.', 'Waitress was nice Man delivering our food was rude and even yelled across the room to get the waitress’ attention. The food was by far the worst food I’ve ever eaten out', 'We stayed at the Resort for the weekend and dined at this restaurant on A Saturday night. Our large group of ten seemed to challenge the server. There was little knowledge of gluten free and no room for menu modifications which was a but disappointing. Half of the group really enjoyed their meals and the other half thought the food to be just fine.', 'We ate at the Cotton and Rye restaurant for both lunch and dinner on July 19 and 20th. The food was inconsistent, did not match the listed menu and the same order of salad was different for three guests at the same table. I do recommend the smoked chicken wings as they were consistently good. Service was poor as they use exchange students as servers and there was some language confusion and they did not seem to have a lot of serving experience. We have been going to this restaurant at least once per year for the last 5 years for a weekend get away and it has never been really good. Despite hoping it would improve, it never has. We are done now.', 'Food was great, service was okay. Server charged us twice, management fixed the next day.', ""Service was really poor. Waitress told us we were wrong and that the Loudon restaurant week was the week before (it wasn't, and we enjoyed two other restaurants that weekend celebrating restaurant week). Requested a steak medium well; it came out rare. I asked for it to be cooked more, and it came back very, very well done."", 'Let me tell you about my very disappointing dinner experience at the Lansdowne Coton Tavern (now renamed Coton & Rye), located in the lobby level of the Lansdowne Resort and Spa. I arrived at the restaurant at 6:30 pm on a Wednesday, it was practically deserted but even so, the hostess was not available to greet new arrivals and I was seated by a passing waiter (that happens sometimes and I\'m totally fine with that). I notice that it\'s really more of a bar that happens to have some food, but it\'s not exactly clear that this is the case. After being seated, I put in my drink order as I reviewed the menu. The waiter returned with my drink and I placed my order for the \\""cheesesteak egg rolls\\"" as an appetizer and the \\""short rib stroganoff\\"" as my main course. No water or bread was offered and my egg rolls came out drenched with the two sauces that were in the description but really should not have been mixed together - sweet and sour sauce and mustard. I thought they would be the dipping sauces that I could choose from, not swimming in both. But before I finished', 'Good place to go for lunch comfort food Sports shoot a little pool play a little shuffleboard good wine selection.', ""We walked out after no one even asking for our drink order or giving us water after at least 5 minutes had passed.

It was very good.', 'The service was very slow and inconsistent. Food was not cooked as we asked for.', ""I think given the location (Lansdowne), the pricing, etc - I was expecting more. The food was just okay, the service was just okay, nothing stood out as bad it just wasn't worth what we were paying."", 'I was early for my reservation and had time to observe. My biggest fault with this location is that the food is brought from another location and is carried through the open hallways of the hotel in the public without any type of cover over the plate. I ordered the Loudin burger which was cooked correctly and came with sweet potato fries. .', 'I thought the food and cocktails were very good. My husband complained that his steak was a bit tough but had good flavor. The service was friendly and attentive. My only complaint was the ambiance. A bit too bright and generic. Seemed like a typical hotel vs. resort restaurant.', 'Don’t go during the holiday season. We were shocked to arrive only to find out someone was holding a party there. No idea if/how we’d still be able to dine there and had not been notified in advance. Also couldn’t find anyone in the place to help us so we left. Had really been looking forward to dinner. Had a much better experience at Piedmont’s.', 'Service was slow and noise level was outrageous! Having teens playing pool adjacent to the dining area is a deal breaker. Even without the kids there, I’ve found Coton to be noisy. Not going back. Seems like management isn’t sure about what this place should be.', 'This is a corporate conference center. Built for large corporate groups. Food service type food. Steam tray breakfast is the only option. Golf shop food only option for lunch. “Tavern” looks more like a conference room with a bar. “Tavern” tables look like a cheap Marriott dining room.', 'The steaks were very unevenly cooked. The texture seemed like they had been previously frozen. Requested medium rare, portions were medium and other were well-done. Very expensive.', 'A convenient option if - like us - you were to be staying at the Lansdowne Resort . Kudos for the drinks menu, including local draft beers and whiskies. Food was poor to average, very bland if decent in terms of portion size. The salmon burger was a particularly big fail. Server tried to be helpful but seemed inexperienced and not able to cope well with our particular requests and questions concerning food and drink options.', ""The food is very good. I had heard about the restaurant opening and waited a while to visit... and expected that it would have less of a hotel vibe and more of a tavern/pub feeling. The (off-menu) cocktails we ordered were very watered down, If I were staying in the resort, I would love to eat here, but don't think I'll make a special trip again."", 'The wait staff was incredibly friendly, especially our bar tender, but our waiter left halfway through the meal to go off shift and we seemed to be forgotten. The food was subpar for what I expected at a nice resort. The salmon was flavorless. The drinks were really good, though.', 'Service very slow.

Great job guys!!', 'The restaurant was more geared to hotel guests and business people. A large group was there while we had dinner and the noise level was high. Once they left it was much quieter. The burger was delicious but the steak tips came with potatoes (tater tots). The steak was a small amount but cooked nicely.', 'Basic sports bar', 'My friend had the wings and seemed to enjoy them. I had the penne squash and zucchini dish, recommended by our server. There were only a few pieces of the vegetables. The dish was primarily pasta and feta cheese. The restaurant was loud and we were seated by in the back by on open door. It was cold.', 'Nice atmosphere, but too loud. brightly painted walls bounce sound too crisply all thru the space. Too loud.', ""I was hoping for a better experience. If I hadn't been with clients, I would have sent the soup back (cold) and the Chicken Pot Pie that was so salty that I am surprised the deer didn't come in from outside for a lick! Ordered appetizers and within 4 minutes the waiter tried to deliver our entrees - ummm, we have barely taken one bite of the appetizer. Then he looked at me with an odd expression when I asked if he could return the dishes to the kitchen to keep them warm until we were ready. Yikes. Really wanted to like this place as the ambiance is OK but it just didn't work out well. Thankfully my guests were pretty chill and didn't fuss about it but it was a bit embarrassing.""]",83

In fact, we were about 5 minutes early and they were kind enough to let us in out of the cold. However, it seems that their start time is a little bit of a slow roll as butter for the rolls was still refrigerated and required heating under a lamp before we could have it at the table. The oysters were excellent (we had 2 dozen for the four of us) and the chopped horseradish was a nice change of pace from the normal minced or creamed style often served with oysters. Also, their hot sauce was excellent. Waiters were attentive if perhaps a little overextended in terms of work. My wife's shrimp and grits while tasty were not warm and I suspect that it was either made ahead of time and reheated or had been placed into the bowl too early while the other food was cooking. The avocado toast was presented well, however, it had been toasted (probably on an open fire grill) a little long and was a little overdone. It was very difficult to cut the toast with the butter knife provided. I'd recommend either lest"", 'There is a limited choice of vodka nothing top shelf. The drinks are very small .

For dinner she had catfish and me ribeye but the star of the show was the mashed potatoes - simply outstanding, best I’ve ever had!', ""Our tuna tartare was extraordinarily delicious. Lovely flavors and a mix of textures. The crostini were divine! So yummy, dessert was not necessary. Our waiter was awful. Inane. Asked if we'd decided what we wanted to order 15 minutes AFTER we'd given him our orders. And on it went like that. Everything that came out of his mouth was surprisingly senseless. He was going to pour more wine. I told him the bottle was empty. He poured (nothing) anyhow. He had no business being a waiter."", 'This is worth a try if you must eat in the Mosaic District, want seafood, and are willing to pay $24/main dish. Our trout was fresh and tasty, but the swordfish was overcooked. The roasted brussel sprouts were good, but you need to request them without the cheese topping. The biscuits are disappointing.', 'We went during the middle of a slow period between lunch and dinner. Kiernan was the only server at the time but was attentive and kind. The food came out quickly. The oyster chowder was really delicious! Nice gem of a restaurant located in the heart of a nice little area.', 'Great food and great service!

Loved the industrial farmhouse decor, the local sourcing, and fresh seafood. Bonus points for the light, warm dinner rolls which are terrific. The bar is good on execution, but really slow. All the dishes are good, some very good, but the catfish with butternut squash was a low point; too much cornmeal breading and way too much squash on the plate.

Everything else was just okay and we ordered just about everything on the menu. Menu needs a reset with some more inspiring options or this will be our last visit. Bottles of wine are overpriced as well. Beers were filled 8/10ths of the glass.', 'I definitely recommend Brine at Mosaic! In fact, when my family comes to visit, that is where I will be taking them. The service was friendly and fast, and the food was exceptional. My youngest son tried swordfish for the first time and loved it. My husband ordered the squid ink linguine (for the first time here in the US) and said that it was every bit as good as the squid dishes he loved in Sicily. My scallops were cooked to perfection and they were very good at accommodating my dairy-free preference. Our oldest son had a burger that was devoured much faster than he should have and declared it extremely good. I also tried the oysters. They were good and I appreciated that you could order them one at a time. If you are going to try oysters for the first time, it is good to do so at a place that has 117 years of history with the mollusks.', 'Perfect quiet Birthday lunch.

We visited on a Friday night at 7pm after a movie. Most, but not all, tables were full and the bar was empty. As a result, the noise levels were not bad; I could see this being a very loud place if it were full and people were waiting for tables (high ceilings, cement floor, no sound-absorbing tiles). Our waiter was juggling quite a few tables, but still did a good job of keeping things moving. Oysters were excellent! We had the swordfish entree and a seared tuna salad. Both were good, but the clam/shrimp pasta and scallop dishes that the table next to us got looked better! Wine list is somewhat limited, although there is a reasonable range of wines available. Would definitely return.', 'If I could have done 4 1/2 stars, that would have been more appropriate. Service started off slow, and it was odd that three different people tended to us before settling on one. There was also the time that the young lady whose job was to refill the water glass, literally leaned across the table over my wife’s food to grab the water glass. I didn’t say anything at the time, but I could tell by the look on her face that she was able to read the look on my face, because she put the glass down on the side closer to her - she could have walked around my wife to put it back where she picked it up from, but regardless. Other than that, overall, it was really good. Totally enjoyed the oysters (appetizers), also, the side Brussels sprouts was reeeaaally good.', 'We were one of the only indoor tables. Took a while to realize why we were getting ignored repeatedly - there were a ton of tables outdoors. I mean we were sitting waiting, over an over, for minutes and minutes for the next step (greetings, drink orders, apps, dinner, check) .

Super find!', 'Brine is our favorite seafood restaurant at Mosaic. We are glad that it has been around a while and hope to return again soon. Get the brussel sprouts!', 'Brine remains one of the few restaurants in our area with no non-alcoholic beers. This is a shame because nothing goes as good with raw seafood as beer. And there are some excellent non-alcoholic beers being produced. Food delivery was slow, and the restaurant was less than half full. We can only assume that everything we ate was freshly made. It certainly tasted that way. Our food was excellent when it finally came. The waiter was attentive and the food is consistently good, so this is one of our favorite places in Mosaic.', 'The raw oysters were very good but the fried oysters were disappointing. Not well seasoned and somewhat soggy (due to sauce) , I would not recommend. My friend got the sword fish which was hammered and I got the squid ink pasta - shrimp was overcooked. For a seafood place that is a shame that they overcooked all their cooked seafood. The service was fine, our server definitely did not go any extra mile - not even an inch. When my friend mentioned the overcooked swordfish - I would expect her to offer to get another, but nope. Instead she agreed to bring a lemon or a lemon sauce. She never asked us for drink refills or asked how the meal was in general. Overall this is not the place to impress. I would say go for the raw bar get a drink and go somewhere else for dinner.', 'Delicious, high quality food and drinks. Great local beer and liquor options. Very attentive staff!']",704

My one criticism is the wait in between visits to your table from the waiter/waitress can be longer than what you'd want from a restaurant. If you forget something like ketchup or need a drink refill it could be a while before you see someone to be able to ask for these things.

Maybe it will be better yhe next visit.', 'Hostess sat us outside in the direct sun no umbrella so we asked to get moved the only option was inside. We requested water while sitting outside and didn’t get it until we were seated inside about 15 minutes later. When we ordered our cappuccino they came out with no saucer, spoon or were asked if we needed sugar. It took asking 4 servers for spoons before we got them. When we finally got our food ordered our new server was amazing!! He was attentive and efficient.', 'Food was very good. Service was not great, kept having to flag down our waitress. It was very warm and stuffy. When I told the server, her response was \\""that\'s just how it is.\\"" Saving money at the expense of the dining experience is not a great way to run a business.', 'Had pleasant outdoor environment to dine in. Service was initially quite slow, as was if they forgot about us. Got better as meal went along. NY Strip was very nice, accompanying fries were fair at best. Plank salmon was also very nice, a healthy portion. Wine was very good, and all of them were at a quite reasonable price for a bottle.', 'Sunday brunch buffet with COVID-19 restrictions is not good. Farmers food is too good for this format. Should go to menu only for everything.', ""I loved the ambiance. Very spacious and eclectic decor. It wasn't overly crowded. Our server was a little slow and forgetful. We ordered off the kitchen menu and had to ask 3 times before he actually brought it out. Given that it wasn't horribly busy, I think the service could've been better. Overall very nice location. I'd try it again."", 'The service was incredibly slow and frustrating; at one point we didn’t see our waiter for 20 minutes and that was after asking another server to take our order. Also, despite the 4% covid surcharge, our waiter and several other servers were wearing bandanas. If you’re going to charge for PPE, please provide it to the staff, and bandanas are shown to be no better than wearing nothing. Lastly, the food was lacking - the beer can chicken was all fat- I had to put my glasses on to find any part that was edible- the “hot fudge” sundae came with a little tin of cold chocolate sauce and no whipped cream - when we asked for whipped cream, they brought a tablespoon; and the medium steak was raw inside, but after waiting an hour for it, my husband ate it anyway rather than wait longer for them to cook it correctly. This was my third time coming here because my family likes it and it has outdoor seating, but I will not be going back.', 'My friend and I decided to try this restaurant for the first time— it had really good reviews, so we thought it was a good choice. Unfortunately, our experience was far from pleasant. From the moment we walked into the restaurant, we received horrible service— the worst, I’ve ever experienced. The hostess took us to our table and when we asked about using the umbrella, ( we were seated in the patio) the hostess replied that they had the umbrellas down because of the wind, using an unpleasant tone of voice. Meanwhile, the table need it to be moved two or three feet closer to the umbrella. The hostess did not offer to have someone move the table for us and just walked away— my friend and I had to lift and move the table ourselves. But this was just the beginning. After the distasteful encounter, my experience here kept going down hill. The server whom seemed pleasant, was either to busy, forgetful or simply thought that my friend and I did not deserve good service. Throughout our entire dinning experience, she kept forgetting to bring our items. Not once, not twice, not three time; at least four times- it', 'Amazing food, great services, awesome overall experience!', 'Outstanding service! Outstanding food! Excellent care taken during this crazy time. Love this restaurant.', 'Ate outside on patio. Ordered prime rib. Was delivered with baked potato which was cold. Server, who was very attentive, replaced with a somewhat warmer parotid. Meat not much warmer and tough. Replaced wife’s prime with a ribeye that was tasteless. Manager did comp wife’s meal. Not a very good impression for first visit.', 'I love Founding Farmers and have never had something on the menu that I did not like until this visit. The Grain Bowls are evidently cold and the waiter never told me that. Also, they forgot to bring our appetizer out. Still good food, but not the service I have received on other visits.', 'Absolutely horrible!! Our server acted annoyed after we waited 30 min for him to bring us plates for the brunch and take our drink order when we are the ones who patiently waited. Food was horrible. Service was crappy. Not enough servers at the brunch line so you have to wait 10 minutes to get a piece of bread. Is this a carnival? Just shut down!!', 'I love Founding Farmers Reston Station, it’s my go to spot for brunch with my son. They are trying their best with the new covid considerations but I think their brunch is really struggling. From this visit, some of the items we ordered a la carte (bacon lollies, eggs Benedict) were cold by the time they got to our table. The stations they set up for brunch are a good idea but often get very congested with lines so people are way too close when trying to navigate multiple lines. Adding a few more people to serve would help. Finally, I made a reservation for a post hockey brunch with 2 moms and 6&7 year old boys. We were in the lobby for almost 10 minutes while the female manager “gave her server some time as he just got assigned 2 tables”. We would have been happy to sit at our table and not try to corral these 2 kids in the lobby, even if we had to wait to be served. We love founding farmers and hope they can sort some of these issues out. Until then we will wait a while before returning.']",2469

Once the table was ready at the back patio (as requested) we were given a horrible seat in a dark abandoned corner besides a utility door.

On our 3rd order, it took 1/2 hour for the dishes to arrive. The waiter did sheepishly apologize, but it killed our desire to order more. The food and setting was good enough that I would recommend it and return for another try, but they do need to work on their pacing if they want to maintain that tapas vibe.', 'Food is amazing!!

The food taste was mediocre, it was just fried white bread with some frozen smoked salmon with a badly dressed salad that was improperly plated around the sandwich so that it was impossible to not spill the salad all over the table. The salad tasted like eating a bunch of onions - it had no other taste and the dressing was awful.

We nibbles on the Italian fries on the side, which are the best fries I’ve ever had (considering they’re cut super thin, which is my preference).

No such luck, instead it felt like we were sitting in a cafeteria. We should have excused ourselves and gone to a different restaurant.

Totally wrong !!! she took it back and eventually returned with a martini glass half filled due to all that ice removed and clean ice in a small glass ...it was not dirty ice. Dinner was extremely disappointing, I had 7 small scallops that looked over cooked and tasted bland, my husband had a ribeye steak that was about a 1/2', 'We had a wonderful time.']",24

I guess the cook was checking to see how done it was. I ordered it medium rare but the steak varied from medium to well from one side to the other.

The gnocchi was wonderful as usual, but the filet was a little tough/grainy instead of the usual buttery texture I am used to. I mentioned it to the server when he asked how everything was, and he took it off the bill entirely. This was more than generous since I ate the grouper and veggies of my surf and turf.

Viele gute und überraschende Gerichte, wir waren zu viert und alle begeistert!', 'Hier gib es definitiv nicht die beste Ente in Berlin. Die Idee zum letzten Hauptgang mit Reis und Ei war eine Frechheit der Kulinarik. Extrem trocken und der Geschmack nach Erdnuss war so überlagernd, dass man gar nichts mehr von der Ente in irgendeiner Weise noch schmecken konnte. Man fragte sich außerdem was der Koch mit der Keule angestellt hat. Niemals im Leben wurde das ausgelöste Fleisch auf 2 Portionen aufgeteilt und verwendet. Die gute Kritik anderer inkl. Journalisten div. Zeitungen scheint von Freunden zu stammen, die jegliche Neutralität vermissen lassen. So stolpert der Gast in ein Desaster am Ende des Menues und man hinterläßt ihm ein Grauen mit dem Wunsch: Könnte ich die saftigen Keule unbehandelt bekommen ohne das der Chef Hand anlegt?

Hat uns gefallen! Trotz Corona Lockdown Limitierungen ein toller Abend. Freundliches Personal und fantastisches Essen! Sehr zu empfehlen.', 'Das Essen war sehr gut, allerdings hätte die Haut ( 1. Gang) mehr Geschmack haben dürfen. Vielleicht Orange oder mehr chinesisches Gewürz zum Marinieren. Auch hätte man sich statt deutschem Pfannkuchen ( fast eine Crepe, und damit zu wenig reissfest für die harte Haut) eher ein einen chinesischen Pfannkuchen mit Koriander gewünscht. Die Entenbrist war auf den Punkt gegart, das Kimchi passte nicht zur sanften Ente. Der Pak Choi war hingegen ausgezeichnet. Ebenso der Schlußgang. Unsere männliche Bedienung war ausgesprochen freundlich und nett. Großes Lob!!!! Die Atmosphäre hat eher etwas von einer Hotel Lounge als von einem Restaurant. Für ein informelles Essen ok, für ein Rendevouz oder ein Geschäftsessen sind die Tische zu wenig separat. Sehr gepflegtes Hotel und Toiletten.

Später gab es Livemusik, die uns nicht gefiel, ist Geschmacksache. Wir hatten die berühmte X-berg Duck. Das Menü begann mit einer Leberpastete, obenauf eine Art knuspriger Crumble, leicht asiatisch gewürzt. Schmeckte ausgezeichnet- war nur viel zu viel. Die Suppe kam mit einem Dumpling, in dem Innereien verarbeitet waren - sehr lecker. Die knusprige Haut war ungewürzt- sie schmeckte nur zusammen mit der Hoisinsauße und den weiteren Zutaten. Das Fleisch ( nur Brust) kam mit einem Asiatisch gewürzten Rotkohl und kleinen Klößen- sehr schöne Soße dazu. Nachtisch Rumfrüchte mit Vanille. Insgesamt dauerte das sehr gute Essen zu lang- wir waren um 19.00 Uhr am Tisch und gingen kurz nach 22.00 Uhr.

I wasn't in love with my cacian chicken with bone tie pasta but that is my fault. I always try something on a menu I've never had before so I don't know what to expect. It was the spices I didn't care for. The garden salad was so fresh and it had just the right amount of dressing, did not cover up the freshness of the vegetables. Cocktail was perfect I look forward to going back to try something new again.

Yes I would recommend this restaurant.', ""Went for restaurant week and while the special menu for restaurant week was a little limited (no choice on appetizer or dessert and no vegetarian/meatless entrée option) we were extremely impressed. The homemade salad dressings were good, the fried chicken was great, but the meatloaf was amazing, stole the show! Dessert was also very good, LOVED the candied pecans. It was $20 for the 3 courses which was a steal in my opinion. They also sat us right next to the fire place so the atmosphere was cozy and romantic. I'd love to go back for a special occasion and since we're engaged figured we'd look at this venue as a possible wedding option."", 'I ordered beef borguignon which arrived barely warm.

All in all very disappointing.', 'First time visiting after seeing it on the Chronicle show. From the time we sat down, ate and left it was exactly 30 minutes. Food came so fast leading us to believe it wasn’t freshly prepared. Service was very uninviting and we were seated at a small table at bottom of the stairs when there were more comfortable tables around us that were empty. Would never go back.', 'Barrows House is a gem reminiscent of a time gone by. We were in Manchester, Vermont shopping with family and Barrows House (a short 10 minutes away) is a favorite of one of our nephews. I can see why! The ambiance in the main dining area was cozy and almost felt like it had been set just for us. We started with a bottle of 2016 Trig Point Cabernet Sauvignon and the Brussels Sprouts and Neuskes Bacon. I think these are the best Brussels I’ve ever had and paired with the Trig Cab was perfect. Then I had the Jambalaya pasta. I’ve eaten Jambalaya many times and Barrows House version is delicious. The sauce has a wonderful smoky flavor but none of the ingredients overpower each other. For dessert we had the molten chocolate cake. Overall it was a wonderful fall dinner in a delightful setting!', 'We had a wonderful time on New Years Eve. Party hats and favors were on all the tables. But the best is that all the food is local and pasture raised for the most part. It was delicious.', 'Great meal in a beautiful dining room with an excellent server who knew the menu well!', 'The service is great.', 'Lovely experience for Christmas Eve, will definitely be back next year!!', 'We were looking for a cozy Thanksgiving Dinner with the ambiance of a Inn and our visit to The Barrows fell short of that expectation. While the Turkey entree was good the Gnocchi was disappointing and overpriced. Our service experience was awkward and we left feeling not happy with our decision to go there for Thanksgiving.']",90

It was nice they could accommodate our large group however we had brought a cake which the restaurant would not allow us to serve.

We all calculated what we had and paid, they automatically charged 18% gratuity.

Our food took longer than expected to arrive, and then was not at the proper temperature. My son sent back his stew, the rest of us were probably too hungry at that point.

My husbands Cobb salad came and it was a bowl of mostly chopped romaine with no dressing. finally got some dressing after requesting it. My family members did get a crab cake and some pasta which they loved so maybe they were just off their salad games tonight. They also marked my reservation as a no show even though I checked in!

For the price, I would have expected that it would have been ample enough to serve a family of 4.

Great seat in a booth overlooking the kitchen area which is a very nice experience. Good cocktail aperitifs. We had a pleasant and attentive waitress, but the white wines we ordered with the starters were mixed up, and whilst the scallop starter was well cooked and beautifully seasoned, the belly pork was pretty tasteless aside from the lift of the compressed apple balls. I told our waitress the pork was under seasoned, and she said “oh ok”. The Tomahawk steak was a beauty to behold and a great thing to share. We were asked if we would like it cooked medium, and we agreed, but it arrived rare. Fine for us but others may be disappointed. The peppercorn sauce was overpowered with pink peppercorns.

But also there were things that made me smile long after I'd eaten them: a tiny cheese pie; fish served with chicken skin; lamb served on the bone with neck, liver, gravy and sweetbread accompaniments. Service was absolutely brilliant, especially with the added wine pairings which each came with a lengthy introduction (the sort of thing you either love or hate; and I love). Best of all is the price. Yes, the food for me only hit 80% of the time but at £49 for five courses (more like 8 with the various amuse and pre-dessert etc.) and £29 for wine pairing this is stunningly good value and you will leave stuffed.

Since a taster menu usually showcases fine and exciting points of a menu, one expects to be blown away by the dishes on offer but they were no better than food we have had in plenty of places and certainly not outstanding. The atmosphere is lively and decor was really stylish. Unfortunately, the service wasn't too impressive. For example one of the courses was forgotten and served out of sync in 5th place, not 2nd. There was no apology when the error was discovered. The waiter merely blamed the kitchen! Added to this, the time lapse between courses was too long, about 20-30 minutes between each small portion of the taster menu.

My husband ordered a steak medium rare and I ordered a Cobb Salad. His steak came out completely rare and then I received the wrong salad with ingredients I am allergic to. My husband didn’t send back the steak but I sent back the salad because I couldn’t eat it due to allergies. When the right salad came out there was so much dressing the salad was wilted and the chicken was undercooked. At this point we just wanted the check and to go home.', 'Great food.

No - this was NOT a cafeteria, but the openness of the dining room and the noise level was sufficiently \\""energetic\\"" and surprised us. Our server (Tien) was very solicitous and helpful, asking if we needed anything, and the pace of our meal was terrific. The food was delicious - although from the website photos I had thought the loaded baked potato would be more robust. My husband and I typically split a meal, and Firebirds did that for us in the kitchen - however serving half a meal on their generous full-size plate made the meal visually less attractive. Again - the food and service were great, consider these comments as possible tips going forward.

The service was excellent and very friendly. It was a Friday night so there were a number of families having dinner. I had my 2 young grandchildren with me and the server was particularly kind to them. Our pizzas arrived in record time. Unfortunately, there was a table with 2 young undisciplined children who thought they were at a playground or McDonalds. The 2 mothers were blind to their children's behaviour and actions for a fine dining restaurant. This made for an unpleasant atmosphere for the other people in the restaurant and the servers too. As the restaurant filled up the noise level understandably increased. I loved the music that was playing but my suggestion might be to lower the volume so it's not competing with the conversations in the room."", 'A “go to” in BWV. Great for the kids too.', 'Love this place. Great wood oven pizza, good with the kids, friendly service.', ""Loved everything up until the waiter almost confused a calzone with a canolli. And do you really close at 9 pm? Why bring the lights on as if it's last call when we've barely finished our coffee? Why the rush?"", 'A solid wood oven pizza place. The beef carpaccio was great too. Servers were pleasant and attentive. No complaints. It was busy, I was surprised. Be sure to make a reservation on the weekend.', 'The food was amazing. The oven is small so it takes some time, but worth the wait', 'Good casual spot. Bloor St pizza was really good! Crust is yummy!', ""Great place, constant turn over of customers. The pizza was one of the best I've have in a very long time. Strongly recommend it."", 'Food 💯 Customer Service 💯 Loved it! Their exquisite pizzas and the taste were amazing! We absolutely loved everything about GATTO Wood oven Pizza! I highly recommend it.', ""Such yummy pizza! Here's a pizza place that understands the importance of crust!"", ""Disappointing pizza and poor service. Food: The restaurant was out of milk (?) on a Friday at 6:30pm so one guest couldn't have any with their coffee, which wasn't an ideal start. Other guests at the table ordered Cola and Ginger Ale and a can was handed to them like a take-out order. The pizza was okay depending on the type, the Murder She Wrote pizza was particularly bad, with thick sliced mortadella placed on top of the pizza in giant rolls. The server raved about how this was the spiciest pizza and yet zero spice was detectable. Service: Our server was consistently rushing past our table without even making eye contact or checking in for the entirety of the meal. One of our guests was new to the English language and the server laughed at her pronunciation of one of the items on the menu. It took almost 30 minutes to get a staff from the restaurant to provide water. Even getting the bill took an additional 20 minutes, which in a small space with no more than 10 tables filled, is unacceptable. Will definitely not be returning!"", 'Great for kids!', 'Hard to find promotional deals or coupons', 'Excellent service and food. Lunch special of soup and pizza was tasty.', 'So SO good! Everything from the ambiance to the service to the food itself was amazing! Would definitely recommend anyone who likes Italian food to check this gem out!', 'Service was great. Food was not good. No flavor at all.', 'We went at noon hour. Our friend couldn’t make it after all so it was just the two of us. Our server was attentive and prompt and anxious to please. And we liked the decor of the restaurant. The food was ho-hum. My rigatoni was bland and boring, and my husband’s pizza was “okay”. It just needs to be a little more interesting as the food selection was good, including the desserts and drinks. Good luck!', 'Our waiter was outstanding!', 'Excellent pizzas in an environment where you can have a conversation without the usual loud noise of most restaurants.', 'A great addition to Bloor West Village.', 'I love the relaxed feel of this place. I definitely would return to try different pizzas. Service was well-timed and friendly.', 'Fantastic pizza and service. It was a really nice touch giving all of the female guests a rose on Valentine’s Day. Will definitely return', 'Everything was good except ambience this time. The lights were on full and with LED, it makes it very bright! Lowering these would contribute to greater ambience, as it was when we visited one other time.', 'What a wonderful surprise! We did not expect to have such a wonderful restaurant in Bloor West Village. The wood oven pizza was aromatic with the right amount of toppings and the crust was just the right thickness and the size was perfect for sharing, we ordered the 2312 Bloor St version, it was truly delicious! For appetizers we had the soup of the day an intensely flavoured Tomato Bisque (which could easily have been a meal in itself) and the Carpaccio and Arugula salad with a heavenly balsamic drizzle. We can’t wait to come back and try the many other selections on the menu. The surroundings were very comfortable with soft music playing in the background. A great place for entertaining or for a quick stopover. Staff was efficient and friendly. Thank you Gatto for a wonderful experience!', 'Nice restaurant located in a very good neighborhood. The pizza is amazing. The menu could have the translation to English language, at least for the basic ingredients like type of cheese, tomato sauce, meat, because it can be confusing for those who does not understand a minimum of Italian.', 'Friday night casual date night. Pizza was awesome. Wine overpriced but ok (ordered the Tuscan). Service was a bit slow to start but ok after that. It was loud with kids such that we couldn’t hear ourselves for a bit but they cleared out 45 min into our dinner so it was ok... not the restaurant’s fault. What was the restaurant’s fault however was that we did have a reservation but the only tables available when we arrived were, in my opinion, the worst tables in the house: right by the door or right in the path of all of the servers. Not sure why we bothered getting reservations. When someone arrived after us, they we’re magically offered seats at the back (away from the door and the loud kids) but these seats were not offered to us?!?!!!!!!!!! WTH!?', 'The server was pushy, obnoxious... She wanted to sell cocktails, mineral water and desserts... The presentations on the pizza were not appetizing and the dough was soggy....It is too bad because the restaurant has potentiel.', 'Empty restaurant when we got there for a weekday lunch but filled up quickly. Service was attentive, pizzas were really good, red wine perfect temperature when served. We will go back again', 'Food and service were both amazing. Highly recommended!', 'Food was yummy but the service was awful! They told us there was no sparkling water and then gave the table next to us a bottle after we asked. Then we waited over an hour for our pizza and overhead the server saying she \\""forgot\\"" to place the order but no one every came over to our table to tell us what was going on. After all this, no discount on our bill. Wouldn\'t go back for this reason.', 'Excellent neighbourhood pizza venue. Been there a few times since it recently opened and look forward to eating here soon again! The only criticism is that they should probably add a couple of vegetarian options.', 'I love the food at Gatto but this experience was horrible. First of all, server was very very rude and yelled at us to STOP as soo as we came in. Second he was arguing with another customer because that customer felt disrespected too. So that already ruined the ambiance before we even sat down. It took so long to get our orders taken and also for it to arrive. Once it arrived, we asked for chilli oil and the server got the leftover oil on a mini bowl from the other table who just left and gave it to us. It still had their pizza crumbs on it. Very disappointed. They offered free dessert for the trouble which i almost didnt take if their tiramisu wasn’t so good. Angry customer from earlier came back because he got overcharged, so another yelling match. I’m still contemplating if i will review on yelp because we actually like this place and the owner was very nice whenever she was there. This time she wasn’t which is pobably why it was chaotic.', 'Last day visiting a friend from out of town. We had taken her to GATTO and she loved it. We went again tonight before she leaves. She picked it', 'Great pizza and great service! A definite go too and a great addition to the neighborhood', 'Would highly recommend. Food is excellent and staff is very pleasant and nice.', 'Everything was perfect.', ""We made a reservation for 7 which was a good idea as there are a lot of walk in customers looking for a spot and while it is a comfortable size, it is not that big. Service was pleasant and the young lady was very attentive and offered water and drinks right away and gave us time to ponder the menu. We split 2 pizza's and a salad between 3 of us and it was quite sufficient. The Bloor West pizza was especially good. It is nice to have a local alternative with really good food in the area. Will definitely go again."", 'The perfect place for a family dinner on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was inviting and the open windows to the street made it pleasant. Very friendly service. Yummy pizza.', ""Very pleased! I went with a friend for a much needed catchup. Here is the general consensus on the food we ordered: olives (app)--could have been warmer and more, full sizes olives. We got a lot of small pieces. Bruschetta (app)--4 pieces loaded up and delicious, very nice. Pizza (margherita)--could have been hotter but overall very good. 4 slices so this is perfect for 2 people. Lasagna (truffle mushroom)--woah, this was seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten in a Toronto restaurant. Or anywhere. SO GOOD. 1 order was perfect for 2 but could have been stretched out for 3 or 4 if you are ordering other things. It is super rich--probably not the kind of thing you'd want to eat alone unless you are planning to take half home. We ended on the flour-less chocolate cake which my friend thought was to die for. I agreed it was good but next time I'd try something else for dessert. All of this plus a beer and two wines was $120 which makes it a really great value."", 'The service was quick, friendly and efficient. The pizza tasted very good but the main problem was the crust. It was chewy and very soggy in the centre. Nice combination of ingredients.']",43

The noise was from the Nextdoor restaurant.', ""Piccolo Mulino is a neighborhood Italian restaurant. It is convenient to the Emelin Theater. We dine there several times a year. The food this time was good, but not the best we've had. The bread seemed like it was stale bread that had been reheated. We had the hot appetizer for two, which was fine but not exceptional. It turned out we hadn't ordered carefully, because both the appetizer and my husband's red snapper were very heavy with mussels. My veal special was good but the veal could have been more tender. Tiramisu was very good. There was a large, very noise group at the restaurant while we were there. Everyone else had no choice but to listen to their conversation. Rude diners seem to becoming more of a problem everywhere!"", 'Third time to this restaurant and the quality of food has been amazing each time. It was nice to sit in the back patio this time.', 'Nice, not very expensive restaurant with average food.', 'Excellent food, service and atmosphere. A gem of a neighborhood restaurant!', 'GREAT Food. Wonderful ambiance and service. Love eating here.', 'Excellent food by the standards of the best Westchester Italian restaurants (Trust me, I’ve been to them.) at bargain prices.', ""I was with a friend, very early for lunch. We sat outside, brought our own wine and shared salads. The waiter could not have been more accommodating or more gracious. Arugula Portobello salad and the caprese salad which included roasted peppers and procuitto was so fresh, so full of taste and so big we didn't get to entrees. We sat outside, which was very pleasant, despite the hot day. Felt like I was in Italy.

Main: shared Seafood Paella - again. Did not disappoint. Clams. shrimp. Calamari and beautifully cooked rice. To top it off it was a date night special pricing thing. Even better. Good meal. Great server. All round good experience. If I could change anything it would be the ambience -it is tough to feel cozy when there’s hardly any tables because of Covid distance rule. And the other suggestion is better outside signage. Even though we both had the address neither of us could find it. you really have to work at it.

First the good, the flaming garlic shrimp were very tasty. The patatas brava were unseasoned and the sauces were very bland (think home fries without salt, pepper, or onions). The croquettas were reminiscent of mozzarella sticks without the flavour and the meat in them was unidentifiable. The mushrooms tasted like mushrooms, the manchego, shallots, and sherry were unidentifiable. Finally, the marinated olives were a joke. The olives are straight out of a jar (pimento included) with a bit of added spices. They should be embarrassed to send those out to customers. We won’t be back.']",162

From the bar staff being slow and getting drinks wrong to average service to food presentation even being below previous visits it was disappointing to say the least. Don’t get me wrong. It wasn’t awful but certainly stopped me from considering this a safe “go to” spot if you wanted to take someone somewhere nice.', 'Great service but the food was very poor quality.

We all ordered steaks to our liking however when my food was presented to me I noticed mine was cooked medium rather than rare as per my order. When I flagged it to the waitress she took it back to the kitchen but returned with the same steak minutes later saying ‘it’s just the lighting in the restaurant’ and it was definitely cooked rare. I complained again, and yet again the same steak was sent back and the chef turned up the lighting in the restaurant trying to make his point.

Then the restaurant had no champagne flutes for the fizz we ordered and were originally given huge wine glasses. As there was only approximately 25 diners in the restaurant at this time we were rather confused to why there was not enough champagne flutes?!

Fantastic value for money and lovely atmosphere 👍', 'Great space with terrace. Hideously understaffed or deliberately slow service. Food portions are not generous, although quality is OK. Cocktails feel low on booze. The Soho Negroni was a dreg in the bottom of a glass. It’s not a particularly expensive place, but it is for what you get for the price. It feels as though everything offered has been doctored to squeeze out a maximum profit whilst providing as little as possible. Very big disappointment.', 'A nice place. Excellent service and food. Very noisy. I was disappointed as I requested in the booking a special cocktail for my wife of 34 years. No cocktail was brought to the table or mentioned.

On arrival we were then passed a menu where it was compulsory to order a main and a desert to then qualify for the bottomless prosecco at an extra cost of £15pp. As this was a birthday surprise for my sister it put me in an embarrassing position to start questioning why we were never informed about the change of cost/menu. Had a nice time but disappointing that we were not informed about this.', ""There were a couple of hen parties at the restaurant when we arrived, which were extremely loud. Although only 6.00pm in the evening, some of the diners were very drunk resulting in falls and breakages. The absence of textiles and soft furnishings meant that there was nothing to absorb the noise, which was deafening at times. The large television showing the movie 'Grease' on a loop was also very distracting.

Lobster was over cooked and rubbery. Steak which was meant to be medium was over cooked. They did cook some more which was very good but obviously came after the other food was finished.

No one bothered to approach me to apologise , my guests did not want to eat the few items which were available, so I went to the restaurant next door , booked a table & came back to collect my guests. No member of staff or management spoke to me & generally the attitude was a couldn’t care less one. This is not a cheap restaurant & if the attitude to customer service does not significantly improve, I do not expect it to stay in business.', 'The venue was quiet but it was a lunch time.

You have wine on menu...either delete selections or my god make a run to the LCBO that is five minute walk from restaurant. Finally what we went there for the pizza. So so disappointing.

Would come back again :)', 'We had the tasting menu. I think the fish and the ribs were the best dishes that day. The duck tartare was not the greatest, but maybe it’s just my preference. Not sure if it wasn’t as fresh as it should be or the spices were slightly off. The squash dish was a bit meh and bland, but again perhaps it’s just my preference. The space is very pleasant and inviting. I would give this place another chance but I don’t think I would go for the tasting menu again. The service was OK, but I think they do better if the table is less than 3-4 people. It becomes difficult for them to coordinate the dishes if there are more than 5 people.

While the menu lists \\""Small plates\\"" and \\""Large plates\\"" these are not meant for sharing so are a misnomer. Carben needs to re-name to Appetizers and Entrees. Food was good but portions were disappointingly small. That said, my duck was delicious and of good portion. The other three at the table did not feel the same. This is a place for a nice lunch rather than the celebratory dinner out we had hoped it would be.', ""Excellent New Year's Eve 5 course blind tasting menu.

We didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation and the tables are far enough apart that we weren't sharing our conversation inadvertently with our neighbours and vice versa.

The noise level was so high it was difficult to have a conversation. My bill came up to $140.00 (incl. tip) which, as far as I’m concerned, is money down the drain. I don’t mind paying that much when the food is good but when it’s average , it’s insulting. The three of us said we would’t go back to Carben.', 'A menu full of very interesting and innovative dishes. We shared the albacore tuna and the wood ear mushrooms and I have to say, these were some of the best small plates I’ve ever had! The smoked wood ear mushrooms are like nothing I’ve tasted before.

All of the American guests were seated upstairs, which was odd. The room was very chilly and brightly lit. We were not initially provided menus, and the waitstaff seemed confused about how to proceed with taking our order and coordinating the service. Nearly all of the food ended up coming at the same time, so it was difficult to appreciate each dish; service felt rushed and lacked coordination. I want to emphasize that the food was very tasty, but the experience as a whole was strange and rather uncomfortable.', ""Il locale è abbastanza elegante, ma con un'atmosfera informale. I piatti sono creativi ed interessanti. Ottima l'horchata de pistache fra le bevande. Il servizio è attento e cortese. Principale difetto, il locale risulta troppo rumoroso, con tavoli troppo vicini l'uno dall'altro. Il prezzo è un elevato rispetto alla media di Città del Messico, ma adeguato per il tipo di locale, la zona di Polanco e la qualità del cibo. In particolare, ho pagato circa 11 € (235 pesos) un singolo bicchiere di vino bianco di media qualità. Chiaramente si tratta di un prodotto importato, e forse in Messico bisgonerebbe scegliere altre bevande, ma in altri ristoranti in Messico ho bevuto vino di qualità simile a prezzi decisamente inferiori.""]",886

Booked for only available time of 8:15 for the banquet as it is the only option for Friday and Sat evening (quite a great looking banquet).

Food took longer than expected considering how quiet the restaurant was. Served ourselves water and had to get our own spoons for the soup. There were plenty of staff, just not really watchful.

This was unsuitable. There was another unoccupied 5 seater table on the other side of the room and it took BEGGING from me for the staff to allow us to take this table instead of the one in front of the kitchen. My friend ordered a coke twice, from two different staff during the meal that never arrived, so he went up to the bar to chase it up. It had apparently never been ordered. (In the end we paid for the extra coke he never received). We also had to ask for sparkling water twice. Even on the other side of the restaurant, the exhaust fans are SO LOUD. It’s not a pleasant dining experience. The food was good.

My recommendation is stick to food what you are good at and either don’t accept late reservations or then give ample time to people to have their food and enjoy as long as they would like. I couldn’t even order desserts so unfortunately my experience wasn’t great.', 'Beef bourguignon was quite fatty and the sauce was pretty tasteless.... for the price it was disappointing', 'It was a really lovely experience.

Entrees came out within half an hour of us seating at the table. Then, mains. An hour went by, and 2 apologises from out server about our meals not arriving. On the third occasion she came out and asked if we had received them yet - we had not. They had forgotten our order. Another half an hour, and they delivered one main that was correct, and one that was completely incorrect. This was returned.

I could barely eat it. The server had offered us a complimentary beverage for our troubles. When we spoke with the gentleman at the register, he shrugged it all off, and then offered a 10% discount.

My pork loin was raw in the middle - that night and the following day I was very unwell with multiple trips to the bathroom.. It was the first time in nearly 5 months that I had attended Tali - nothing changed my mind about going back.

My girlfriend couldn’t eat much of the dishes so I had to force myself to eat most of them to not embarrass ourselves or the chefs (which we are too).

Albacore tuna, beef carpaccio and cod were prepared well but nothing special in terms of the flavour. Sunchokes dish really stood out and it was the best dish of the night. My desert (panna cotta) was terrible, it was salty and ingredients didn’t work together, my friend had a donut and seemed to be more satisfied. Even oysters were served without mignonette or lemon but with 2 sauces, flavourless green concoction and a boring spicy one.

OK, we went online to check the menu - not big deal. But waiting for the waiter to take our order .... Was unacceptably long, so I had to find the waitress and ask her to come.

We ordered a round of drinks and appetizers to start and ordered our mains shortly after. As a former server, I was a bit concerned that our server was not writing anything down, especially because we had asked for his recommendations and engaged him in conversation.

I would definitely eat here again.', 'We visited this restaurant last year and had a very positive experience. The name of the place is correct; the restaurant has great views and is a very nice place. However, we had some issues this time, which was probably bad luck. Our waitress told us up front that her favorite appetizer is the\\""duck bomb\\"". My wife and I do not like this; we sometimes feel that such recommendation may just be a method to sell something that the restaurant wants to get rid of. Anyway, because we like smoked duck breast (the ingredient of the \\""duck bomb\\""), we ordered it. It was a prosciutto wrapped medley of cheese and a bit of duck breast that I had a hard time to taste because the prosciutto overwhelmed everything. Anyway we like prosciutto; it was OK. The special was white fish. I repeatedly asked how it is prepared and served but to my surprise it arrived with a lot of beet (so did my wife\'s chicken). I do not eat beet. Anyway, I pushed it aside, but both the white fish and the chicken, my wife ordered, were overdone, dry. Our waitress was a very nice person, who paid a lot', 'To start my fiancé and I were planning a date night for a while. We had our babysitter lined up and heard good things (word of mouth) so made reservations. The restaurant is located on the ground floor of the Delta Hotel which means easy parking and access to the waterfront boardwalk. We were greeted and seated promptly and were immediately served by our wonderful waitress Julia! She knew the menu in and out and could offer wine pairing suggestions for us. I drink Scotch and am learning about wine selections so I appreciated this. The restaurant offers a recorking service at no extra charge and so we bought a bottle knowing I could drive home and drink the rest there. Julia filled our glasses with iced water and sought our Pinot Noir. Next we were greated by the chef, Oliver, who was experimenting with a new Korean beef taco dish and offered us pretty samplings that we begged to order but unfortunately they were not menu items yet! He was young, professional and clearly enjoyed his career. We were delighted to know who was cooking our meal! We started with Duck Bombs! This appetizer item cannot be overstated. Sautéed', 'Fabulous food. Duck bombs are to die for. Lobster ravioli was scrumptious. Steak was perfectly done.', 'Best restaurant in Sault Ste Marie, hands down!!! From the service to the food and the amazing View!', 'We loved it. A new Chef who came out to see how we liked our dinner. When I reserved my table with you I requested it by the window and we got that! Service delightful and friendly. Food was excellent!', 'Our server was delightful. Dinner was tasty, although the beef ravioli was only warm-cool- it must have been sitting awhile before served to us. The quiness chocolate cake was stale and we could hardly put our fork into it. The server quickly removed it from our bill when we told her.', 'Service was very slow ....even for drinks at the beginning. Food was OK, but not really worth the price. Beautiful setting', ""Unfortunately when we arrived the hostess told us right away that our table was reserved for 12pm, even though I had made the reservation online, days before. So we basically had to rush through breakfast and didn't have the option of the Buffet Brunch. We would have spent more money on the brunch than ordering off the menu, so its too bad The View lost out on that. We felt very rushed, and once we left, the restaurant was empty so not sure what the hurry was?! Still on the fence as to whether or not I would return."", 'Strong attention to keeping customers safe in a world of Covid. Great service! Enjoyed the visual of my dish and definitely the taste! Will certainly return.', 'Staying at the hotel on a guys motorcycle trip and the restaurant was conveniently located on lower level. The staff and service was friendly, fast and excellent. The view of the river from the table was a plus. The food was presented well, cooked and seasoned perfectly. One of the members of our group said he would come back to the hotel just to eat the same dish her ordered in the restaurant. An excellent choice if in the area.', 'Great service, wonderful view, a lovely setting to celebrate a milestone or special occasion', 'The View is always our special event place to go- love the atmosphere and the food is delicious and beautifully presented.

Lots pf choices for all preferences and diet types."", 'The table was in a terribly place in the restaurant-right in the middle in an awkward place that made you feel like you were on display-and so small there was barely room for the glassware. The lighting was far too bright as well. Not a comfortable or enjoyable experience overall.

They do bring the cheaper ones over quite often But when I asked for the chilli beef it took over 20 minutes to arrive. The main problem was the service. No one came to the table to offer us more drinks and the staff were impossible to get hold of.

The menu was limited but had enough choices in each category not to be stuck. The portion was small and the prices were high. The in between meal tastings were a nice unexpected addition. But really not recognizable either by looks or taste. The waiter should have identified what they were. The main courses were lacking in sides, the same feeling of unrecognizable vegetables concoctions as the mid meal tastings. I had the four delicious scallops, which would have been fine if it was accompanied by a recognizable amount of vegetables.

It takes a creative chef to be able to cook only local produce and proteins from local sources. He does an admirable job of sticking to that ethic. The food is mostly excellent but the experience is somewhat diminished by the length of time it takes between courses. We ate on a Sunday night with only four or five tables occupied by twos and fours. There were three people running the restaurant - the chef and two servers. Our appetizer, main and dessert meal took over two hours with long pauses before and between courses. The wine list consists of only organic wines although there was a reasonable selection. The issue with organic wines in my view is that you can get \\""off\\"" wines occasionally due to natural yeasts and bacteria, as was the case with the first wine we ordered. There was no issue with returning it and the second choice bottle was fine. I give the restaurant kudos for their locavore ethic and food quality and very pleasant servers but I sometimes felt I should have brought a book to read', ""You have to know what you're getting into. The restaurant sources all of their ingredients from the state of Maine. (Olive trees don't grow in Maine, so there is no olive oil.) Also, the ingredients are seasonal. This is a challenge the Vinland set for itself and the chef regularly meets the challenge. The food looks appealing and the restaurant has a casual and minimalist decor. We were happy with the meal and the service. We thought it was reasonably priced."", ""We're mystified about the high praise others have written. From a starter featuring a cheese fondue that looked and tasted like lukewarm cheese-whiz (and what about those carrots, so poorly cut that some ends were wobbly and the tops were an inch thick?) to the dense and somewhat gritty rice biscuit that came with the lobster, we sensed a lack of pride and real investment. Perhaps we hit on an off night, but from the lack of other diners present in a city bustling with eager eaters, we are not alone in our experience. While it is great to know that everything is locally sourced and organic -- of which we were reminded at every turn -- this alone doesn't create a great dining experience."", 'Excellent cuisine, excellent menu, excellent service', 'Excellent food and service. All locally sourced food and ketogenic diet, gluten free friendly.', ""The food was excellent. Selection could have been better and the cost was high, but I suppose that's understandable for a locally sourced, small restaurant."", ""I had higher hopes for Vinland. My biggest gripe is that the service, while pleasant, felt inattentive. The food was prepared creatively, but that's because of the kitchen philosophy which restricts any ingredients that are not local -- so no olive oil, lemons, spices, etc. (fortunately they made an exception for wine). These days everyone seems to be on the local bandwagon, so maybe it's their way of trying to stand out. However, I wish they just had a philosophy of just making truly good food, my meal would have been much better."", ""Our server (the only one) did a great job but we were standing for a bit before told it was open seating even with a reservation(we didn't know). It really was a great meal, the plating was fantastic."", 'My sister and I were on a road trip to Nova Scotia and staying overnight in Portland. Our brother recommended Vinland as he was there a few months back. We sat at the bar as recommender by brother. Very interesting to see the operation from that vantage point. Had the salad with the blue cheese vinaigrette. Excellent but the lettuce could have been washed better. A little sandy. Also had the cheese fondue appetizer, which was excellent. I had butter poached lobster which was wonderful. Sis had the steak which was delish. Don’t miss the parsnip pudding or the blueberry compote dessert. Both very very good. Also had a white wine, I forget the name, but was great and organic. A great meal!', 'Maybe I would recommend it. A few points. I am not a massively huge fan of local food, but I am definitely a fan, so that was great. As for organic, I may have suffered from chemicals consumed in my 73 years - a two time cancer survivor - both handily addressed through timely surgery - but I do firmly believe we are consuming lots of toxins, and they are having an impact on our earth and our health. We LOVED the slow pace. Unfortunately the 4 of us were headed for the theater, but the time we spent was very relaxed, intimate and enjoyable. If I come again, I will stay in a hotel, and settle in for the 2-hour mealtime. The service was outstanding. Everything was clearly explained, our server, Robin, is professional , Knowledgeable, and had a good sense of who we were. I must say, after learning that my Lamb had been cooked Sous Vide, I had very high expectations. Perhaps it was the lack of salt, but it was also not as tender as I was expecting. So as for a recommendation, I would not recommend it to most of my friends because they would', 'One of the most creative, unique, friendly, and artistic restaurants in Portland. My sister and I both cook in restaurants and agree that it is the best dinner in town. They deserve to be booked full every night. Everything is local, organic, and gluten-free, what more could you ask for? After splitting 4 small plates and a dessert I felt satisfyingly full but not bloated or sickly full. Definitely don’t miss this place, it is a true diamond in the rough.', 'Fabulous as always. Most interesting delicious inspirational restaurant ever been to with repeatedly creative and delicious meals. Can’t recommend more highly!', ""Vinland, simply said, is sublime; elegant yet austere. I love this place and make a point to dine here on every visit to Portland. Chef Levi's talent is truly evident in his food and commitment to locally sourced product.

Otherwise, all was good.', ""Ate here last night for our wedding anniversary as we had heard good things. The food did NOT disappoint: turnip soup was excellent, large chicken plate was cooked perfectly and the smoked eggplant was divine. However, there were a few issues unrelated to food quality. First, we ordered a cheese plate appetizer which never arrived. Second, our server was not attentive and was slow to offer a second round of drinks (my husband's cocktail glass was empty for at least fifteen minutes and she cleared plates away without seeming to notice). Third, one of the servers (not sure if it was ours or another employee who kept walking by) was not wearing deodorant and it was... noticeable. Fourth, we were seated at a table that was less than two feet from the bar and unfortunately one of the bar patrons was very loud and distracting as she talked to her friend; not the best ambiance for a romantic dinner. Finally, as we had read in prior reviews, the time between courses was exceptionally long. It took over thirty minutes after ordering for our soup to arrive (which is prepared cold) and another twenty minutes for the chicken and eggplant to"", 'The food is spectacular.

Also, try the dirty martini made with mushroom liquid, they call it a Knickerbocker.', 'Overall, it was one of the best dinners I’ve ever had!! The food was just so fantastic! The sous vide lamb was to die for! Our server was also fantastic but they were understaffed it seemed because service was slow. They gave us a free aperitif for our trouble which was super nice. We were in very close proximity to the next table and they were kind of loud. We ended up having a nice chat with them so it worked out but I could see how it could go the other way too. I can’t wait to go back!!', 'The concept of no gluten, locally sourced, and organic food was perfect. We left feeling good despite a large amount of food, so yes it was healthy. The service was very friendly but not too intrusive. We will go back every time we are in Portland. Knowing you can go out to dinner and feel like you ate very healthy and you feel it, is great and too bad there are not more restaurants like this.', 'As always, David’s menu is eclectic and each dish is extraordinarily executed. The flavor of the squash soup was very delicate, as was the turnip purée under the day boat scallops. My partner had the radicchio first course, and the flavors there were also very subtle and delicious (it was also a plate full!). As always the muscle dish was really done well. The quality of the shellfish coupled with David’s prep and broth was as always perfect. For dessert, we had the usual parsnip custard (no surprise, always a nice way to end a meal here) and the apple crostini (new to us) was incredible. I will order again if it is on the menu the next visit!', ""Can't wait to come back! Great food. Very interesting menu. We had a 6 course Valentines tasting menu, with 2 different items in each course. Each course was memorable. Save room for the parsnip ginger custard - had it not been on the tasting menu, I would have passed it over. I only wish the serving size was twice as big."", 'Excellent dinner on a very quiet evening. Sat at the kitchen counter and chatted with the chef and staff all night about food and other topics. Very enjoyable. Food was excellent and fascinating. Unreservedly recommended', 'Disappointing. They were out of 2 of the 4 offered appetizers. They were out of the house made vermouth that was the basis for the majority of their offered specialty drinks. The halibut gravlax had not been cured. Merely a pile of stringy raw halibut with very little taste. For a small venue that touts local fare someone in the kitchen isn’t doing their job.

It was recommended as one of the best places in Portland, where the competition is stiff.

I had to grab a slice of pizza afterward cause I was still hungry.', 'This was our first trip to Portland, and a little research had led me to make a reservation at Vinland. When we arrived at 6:30, there was only one other couple, but, by the time we left, several other groups had joined us. (Portland foodies are typically younger and enjoy dining later than we retirees do.) The tasting menu was a bit complicated, but the wait staff was attentive and helpful with de-encryption. Every course arrived with a lovely presentation -- the first, turnip soup with edible blossoms, spectacularly so -- and each was interesting and remarkably delicious in its own right, although we were hard-pressed to come up with a theme beyond, \\""Wow, that\'s really amazing!\\"" The butter poached lobster and chicken with crispy skin are not to be missed. My only criticism -- and it\'s a minor one -- is that the chairs are not the most comfortable for seniors. Nevertheless, we will be back, whenever we are in Portland, and I will simply bring my own seat cushion.', 'Don’t go if you’re looking for an easy, big meal. Go because the food is incredible and it’s just FUN. It’s so organic, actual small bugs crawled out of the edible flowers on my chicken. The portions are small, but they’re AMAZING.

Made in Maine at it’s best.', 'We enjoyed the five course tasting menu with wines. The food was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked.

Get those and some fries for dinner, and you won't be sorry. I often try something different when we go there, but nothing ever beats the boneless wings! This was our first dining experience outdoors at NYAJs and to be honest the ambiance isn't great. It's right next to two fairly busy roads and the only thing helping with the traffic noise is the fact that the seating area is surrounded by a berm.

Also we let them know in advance that it was my wife's birthday and not a mention of it the whole evening. Finally I had to tell the waiter so they would bring a candle on her dessert.

At one point, I asked him a question, and it caused my friend to “please stop being so rude.” He never once made eye contact or apologized. His appearance was one of someone who may very well been wearing the same clothes he had on the night before. Both my friend and I have been t this establishment many times, and this not the kind of person you want representing your company.', 'They had their same great menu and they took safety seriously. Bravo.', 'Awesome Food and Exceptional Service. There were very few people inside - most on the patio.', ""I normally really like Not Your Average Joe's, especially the location in Rockville. However the food was not good at this location (admittedly it was a limited menu because of COVID).

I chose this restaurant for my birthday because one of my friends helped open the art gallery and I liked the concept of the space.

The host was the most friendly and helpful person of the night, as he greeted my guest and I with a smile and enthusiasm, as I would hope for when dining out anywhere, not to mention on my BIRTHDAY with the intent on spending good money. Our server seemed like it was her first night working in a restaurant, as she was very spacey and awkward. She didn't seem to know what they had on the menu and had to read the menu to talk about it, which was pointless because all she did was read exactly what the menu said without providing any other insight or detail.... almost as though she thought we were incapable of reading.

We were a party of 5, with children and grand parents and the cuisine pleased all of us. We recommend to share a bit of everything. Fish, meat, vegetarian, many options, all tasteful.

Empty restaurant. Hard to give you a review.', 'The dinner was good with some nice surprises, and most of the team were really sweet and positive. Our main server brought some seriously bad vibes to the table from the beginning, and then escalated it from there. She poured a completely flat glass of sparkling wine to my friend, and it even looked like there was cork in it. My friend pointed out that it was flat and got a weird defensive response “that’s sparkling wine, it was just opened a few minutes ago”. She went ahead and replaced it and sure enough the new glass was actually sparkling. After that she just came across as pouty and passive aggressive, which is pretty lame on a holiday like that. My friend is chinese btw and not used to pretending things are fine when they’re obviously not, so I would rank her as requiring intermediate customer service skills to serve. Not nearly so bad as to bring on that kind of unprofessional retribution. Like I said though, everyone else was gracious and attentive if a little anxious, I wonder if the manager scared everyone somehow before dinner. The tier-2 wine pairing was nice but the tier-1 was not a good', 'Really enjoyed the ambiance and the overall vibe. Food was good all around with the Chefs Board being the top of the heap. My overall impression was positive without quite hitting it out of the park.', 'Atmosphere, food, presentation and service were better than expected.', 'You know you are in for a great evening when you walk in and the space its self is fun and interesting. The meal follows suit. We ordered everything to share including the cinder block steak, that was perfectly cooked and with all the other food we got just the perfect amount of food. Top recommends would be the carrots, the pork belly and the halibut. The sweetest pastry chef came out to bring us the desserts and explain where the inspiration came from for each offering that really rounded the meal out. Overall this was a perfectly captured San Francisco night out, with service being spot on and the atmosphere matching the quality of the chefs preparations. Will def be back as we did not get to try any of the cocktails on the menu and could sit and talk to the chefs all night long.', 'Amid the virus, we decided to brave a night out.

When our food finally arrived, she never came back to ask if we needed anything (which we did because the dressing was wrong and we needed drink refills or wanted another beer.

Would highly recommend', 'Ambiance, food, music, staff were all fantastic Will definitely return', 'Food was very good and reasonably priced. Service was slow.', 'The ONLY negative part of our experience was the service. Took over 25 mins for the server to come over to us even after I asked for them to send our server, never ideal when you are dining with children. It was very busy and probably just had a newer/inexperienced server. That said, the food was on point and the waterfront location was perfect!! Pricing was very fair. I would definitely go back again and recommend this restaurant to anyone!', 'The host and server that day were really friendly, punctual, and accommodating.

Diablo sandwich and the bowls are perfect', ""Had a reservation for 8:15, showed up and the restaurant was straight up closed.

Service was friendly, fast, and very proactive. This will be a new staple of mine for sure', ""Brought relatives from out of town to Joe Bird on a Saturday evening in mid-September. Patio view is pretty good though I do prefer the view at Amsterdam's down the street. Your chances are better at Joe Bird to be seated at the patio in my opinion. Ordered a bunch of shared items. Patatas Bravas were a bit soggy. Grilled chicken was very tender; fried-chicken up to par with Union Chicken. Corn bread not up to par with BBQ establishment or what you would find at a rib-fest - a bit dry and bland. Dry-rub wings are well-seasoned and juicy (approx. six pieces per pound). Brussel sprouts were a bit too charred and a bit too sweet. I would come back to try other items but among the few patios at Harbourfront I think the ambiance was the best here. Have not been to Goodman's next door but the menu didn't look as appetizing."", 'First time and we loved it. Service by Irish server was outstanding. Loved the setting by the water. Thank you.', ""Always a pleasure coming to Joe Bird's. Love their fried chicken & the sides are good too. The view of the lake is a bonus as well!""]",53

Subbed out the fries for a veggie medley and the veggies consisted of bean sprouts, cut up green beans and a couple pieces of eggplant. First time I've ever seen that and it looked and tasted aweful.

We asked on arrival and we were informed that they have heaters but because “there is a shortage of propane gas due to Covid” their heaters were not available for use. We fortunately had blankets in our car to wrap in while we had our dinner but we feel that a restaurant , especially one with the price point and caliber of this one, should offer heaters for the comfort of their patrons. We have been to several other restaurants recently and their patios all had functional heaters running on propane. This is why we have given this restaurant a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating. The service and food were excellent so why detract from your customer’s experience because they are cold?! Come on, no propane..that’s weak.', 'Food was good, flavorful and well presented. Oysters were severely lacking in size. Had they been even small they would have tasted better but canned oysters were bigger. Hopefully it was just because of off season?! Even with a smaller menu there is still plenty of selection.

After our meals were delivered we had a similar issue in trying to get the bill. We understand restaurants are really suffering with the pandemic and try to support them as much as we can (only eating outside or carrying out, but always tip quite a bit), but the very poor service for the price we paid for the meal was very disappointing.', 'The buffet was a bit overcrowded and service was slow from the bar and the kitchen.', 'My friend and I visited for restaurant week.

My one criticism is the wait in between visits to your table from the waiter/waitress can be longer than what you'd want from a restaurant. If you forget something like ketchup or need a drink refill it could be a while before you see someone to be able to ask for these things. It's been that way since they opened and hasn't really changed. if you know everything you want to order by the time they come to your table the first or second time you should be fine.

We were willing to make the most of this situation and try to pick and choose items we wanted to eat from the brunch offering. We were paired with a server who lacked empathy and emotional intelligence, and took it very personally when I asked her why the restaurant week menu was unavailable when we were also not notified by opentable beforehand. Instead of passing my question unto a manager, she replied by emphasizing that she is not the person to speak with and pretty much threw our serving plates down on the table - it made a loud noise and that's when everything went downhill.

Plank salmon was also very nice, a healthy portion. Wine was very good, and all of them were at a quite reasonable price for a bottle.', 'Sunday brunch buffet with COVID-19 restrictions is not good. Farmers food is too good for this format. Should go to menu only for everything.', ""I loved the ambiance. Very spacious and eclectic decor. It wasn't overly crowded. Our server was a little slow and forgetful. We ordered off the kitchen menu and had to ask 3 times before he actually brought it out. Given that it wasn't horribly busy, I think the service could've been better. Overall very nice location. I'd try it again."", 'The service was incredibly slow and frustrating; at one point we didn’t see our waiter for 20 minutes and that was after asking another server to take our order. Also, despite the 4% covid surcharge, our waiter and several other servers were wearing bandanas. If you’re going to charge for PPE, please provide it to the staff, and bandanas are shown to be no better than wearing nothing. Lastly, the food was lacking - the beer can chicken was all fat- I had to put my glasses on to find any part that was edible- the “hot fudge” sundae came with a little tin of cold chocolate sauce and no whipped cream - when we asked for whipped cream, they brought a tablespoon; and the medium steak was raw inside, but after waiting an hour for it, my husband ate it anyway rather than wait longer for them to cook it correctly.

Unfortunately, our experience was far from pleasant. From the moment we walked into the restaurant, we received horrible service— the worst, I’ve ever experienced. The hostess took us to our table and when we asked about using the umbrella, ( we were seated in the patio) the hostess replied that they had the umbrellas down because of the wind, using an unpleasant tone of voice. Meanwhile, the table need it to be moved two or three feet closer to the umbrella. The hostess did not offer to have someone move the table for us and just walked away— my friend and I had to lift and move the table ourselves. But this was just the beginning. After the distasteful encounter, my experience here kept going down hill. The server whom seemed pleasant, was either to busy, forgetful or simply thought that my friend and I did not deserve good service. Throughout our entire dinning experience, she kept forgetting to bring our items. Not once, not twice, not three time; at least four times- it', 'Great dinner!', 'Amazing food, great services, awesome overall experience!', 'I love Founding Farmers and have never had something on the menu that I did not like until this visit. The Grain Bowls are evidently cold and the waiter never told me that. Also, they forgot to bring our appetizer out. Still good food, but not the service I have received on other visits.', 'Absolutely horrible!! Our server acted annoyed after we waited 30 min for him to bring us plates for the brunch and take our drink order when we are the ones who patiently waited. Food was horrible. Service was crappy. Not enough servers at the brunch line so you have to wait 10 minutes to get a piece of bread. Is this a carnival? Just shut down!!']",2464

We were willing to make the most of this situation and try to pick and choose items we wanted to eat from the brunch offering.

Lastly, the food was lacking - the beer can chicken was all fat- I had to put my glasses on to find any part that was edible- the “hot fudge” sundae came with a little tin of cold chocolate sauce and no whipped cream - when we asked for whipped cream, they brought a tablespoon; and the medium steak was raw inside, but after waiting an hour for it, my husband ate it anyway rather than wait longer for them to cook it correctly.

Meanwhile, the table need it to be moved two or three feet closer to the umbrella. The hostess did not offer to have someone move the table for us and just walked away— my friend and I had to lift and move the table ourselves. But this was just the beginning. After the distasteful encounter, my experience here kept going down hill.

I would have liked my dish a little spicier, but not having been there for a while, medium was safe. We had an early reservation (5:30), as one person had to be somewhere else at 7pm. They weren't busy. In fact, we had to wait for them to unlock the door, as the restaurant doesn't open until 5:30. The wait staff seemed hesitant to approach the table; I'm all for them not hanging around, but I also don't expect to have to flag someone down to take my order. This also meant we didn't leave until almost 7. One thing I disliked, was that the staff took the leftovers that were to be packed to go, back into the kitchen.

The bao buns were a little chewy, however the flavours were good. Our mains were the house specialty of barramundi in green curry sauce. We both thoroughly enjoyed this dish and would order it again. We shared a smashed pav dessert from the specials board. Prices were mid-range.

Menu and wine pairing are out of this world.', ""Had noticed this site many times and since it had such great reviews we decided to check it out. We were the only ones when we arrived which wasn't reassuring but we were told it would fill up soon. It appeared to be a neighborhood spot as others arrived for dinner later in the evening and seemed to know each other. I have been to similar wine bar restaurants in Virginia and Maryland and none of them had a cork fee for the wine if bought while dining in, but we were assured it was still less than most restaurant markups. Saw the same wine at Total Wine for $21 versus the $35 dollars we were charged, but they did allow us to choose another wine when the first recommendation was not very good. The food was moderately priced and the crab cake dish and fries were better than average, however the highly recommended lamb chops were pretty bland. It could have just been an off night for the kitchen since the majority of the reviews I had read were favorable. Sure it is a great place for locals but I would not make the drive again."", 'Party of six to celebrate my mother’s birthday. The service was excellent - our super professional and relaxed server never wrote a single thing down even through there was a lot of back and forth while ordering (impressive!).

I was quite embarrassed to be told, “well you’ve been sitting here for two hours (where had ordered a total of 5 cocktails in that time).

We enjoyed our meals and we also enjoyed the wine .', ""Not sure what is happening to Lasseters in general, as it was overall a pretty poor experience (check in/cleanliness of accommodation/room service). The night we ate at Tali it was very quiet. Servers had a hard time picking up on cues, waited ages for someone to even take our initial drink order......ended up ordering drinks with main meal. Food took longer than expected considering how quiet the restaurant was. Served ourselves water and had to get our own spoons for the soup. There were plenty of staff, just not really watchful. I ordered my usual Butter Chicken (my usual favourite on the menu), but the recipe had changed and not as good as what it used to be. Dessert $16 advertised as roasted pineapple. Ended up with 3 thin sugary pineapple rounds from out of a tin (obviously from a tin, wasn't fresh) with a ball of icey vanilla ice cream and a couple of biscuit crumbs. Very disappointed :("", 'Every time we eat at Tali, we are seated at the table next to the kitchen and the exhaust fans. It is impossible to have a conversation at this table. For this visit I kindly asked the restaurant for us to be seated elsewhere. Initially, they were willing to investigate the possibility of moving us. Offering us a square 4 seater table for 5 guests. This was unsuitable. There was another unoccupied 5 seater table on the other side of the room and it took BEGGING from me for the staff to allow us to take this table instead of the one in front of the kitchen. My friend ordered a coke twice, from two different staff during the meal that never arrived, so he went up to the bar to chase it up. It had apparently never been ordered. (In the end we paid for the extra coke he never received). We also had to ask for sparkling water twice. Even on the other side of the restaurant, the exhaust fans are SO LOUD. It’s not a pleasant dining experience. The food was good. Delivered in a timely fashion, and was hot, but hard to enjoy in that environment.', 'They had a new and apparently better menu, but I was disappointed. The dish tasted very nice but the idea of an entree sized main dish is not one I wish to repeat. Yes I did purchase additional vegetables.

I made a reservation for 8:45pm and Food was very average. Also staff was trying to push us to wrap up fast as they were going to close for night. My recommendation is stick to food what you are good at and either don’t accept late reservations or then give ample time to people to have their food and enjoy as long as they would like. I couldn’t even order desserts so unfortunately my experience wasn’t great.', 'Beef bourguignon was quite fatty and the sauce was pretty tasteless.... for the price it was disappointing', 'It was a really lovely experience. The wait staff seemed to stretched a little too far when we arrived but that seemed to get better after 30 minutes. The wait staff were very professional, thoughtful and nice. The food really good in presentation, quality and taste and was good value. We were seated for two and I was not on a chair but on leather cushion. The padding was very worn and I was sinking in. We asked t be moved and the wait staff accommodated us to a similar seating arrangement. After sitting in that for an our it was sinking in too, it probably needs to be replaced.', 'The Rack of Lamb was fabulous. Better than I could have possibly imagined.', 'Meal was very nice. Service was great. Staff attentive.', 'Myself and my partner went to Tali for our anniversary. Initially, all went well. Order entrees and mains. Entrees came out within half an hour of us seating at the table. Then, mains. An hour went by, and 2 apologises from out server about our meals not arriving. On the third occasion she came out and asked if we had received them yet - we had not. They had forgotten our order. Another half an hour, and they delivered one main that was correct, and one that was completely incorrect. This was returned. Meaning my partner had to eat without me, despite it being an anniversary dinner. Another 15 minutes dragged on, and I receive the worst, dry piece of salmon I’ve ever been presented. I could barely eat it. The server had offered us a complimentary beverage for our troubles. When we spoke with the gentleman at the register, he shrugged it all off, and then offered a 10% discount. We already get this, because we are members. He then stated there was nothing he could do. Poor form. 2 and a half hours for 2 courses of food is ridiculous. Given we’re locals, you’d expect they’d want to', 'The cleanliness was extremely poor - there were chips from previous diners underneath the table next to us. There was food on the floor. The tablecloth had black marks on one corner. We inquired as to why there was not cutlery on the table - the explanation is in contrast to the same question from another restaurant attached to a hotel with similar rating and occupancy.. My pork loin was raw in the middle - that night and the following day I was very unwell with multiple trips to the bathroom.. It was the first time in nearly 5 months that I had attended Tali - nothing changed my mind about going back. The only redeeming feature was the quality of the service - that was excellent, especially when my wife to have her chips \\""extra crunchy.\\"" They weren\'t upon arrival but they were the after my asked to have them re-cooked.', 'Not a pleasant experience, menu was expensive and limited, only one Veg option, no kids veg option, $40 for a bowl of soup that tasted muddy. Only thing we liked was the shoe string chips, had been looking forward to going there. Food was even worse than Juicy Rump. Outside was nice but cigarette smoke from balconies was blowing in.']",93

We had a beautiful experience - the food was outstanding, and the staff were super attentive and friendly.

The experience was let down by the service. The staff did not want to be there and did not want to serve us. We asked for a coffee at 9pm but were told the machine had been switched off. A few minutes later while eating our dessert the staff all sat down to their staff dinner. We were given the bill and told to show ourselves out when we were finished.

The food was excellent and everyone worked hard to make our time on the patio relaxing and enjoyable. Thanks to the chef and to the amazing staff working on the patio.', 'Our party was seated on the patio which had a very fun vibe, with relaxing and upbeat music. The waitress we had provided excellent service. I would definitely come back and recommend this place. The menu did not provide a lot of variety, but the dishes that we ordered were all delicious (chicken sandwich, burger, and veggie burgers). Drink menu had good selection.', 'Watched a restaurant do its best to adapt to the new normal, and the staff is doing a great job. The hamburger is great. The only reason why I marked 4/5 for value is that the takeout menu has the burger at $12.00, and the dine-in price is at $18.00. What was not made clear is if the take-away meal comes with fries - but even if that is the case - a $6.00 variance seems excessive.', 'Amazing food: Tomato - Peach -Moza Salad & Commissary Birher', 'We chose to eat on the patio, which had ample space between tables and a good amount of shade. This is so much quieter than many other patios because it is not on a street. All COVID precautions were being taken very seriously. It was a very enjoyable meal.', 'The breakfast sandwich is SOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOO Good :~) Blow your mind, best breakfast sandwich of life, good. I almost dont want to tell you how good it is becauuuuse when you eat it, you will want to eat it everyday and you will make it harder for me to get a reservation. So...dont do that please :~)', 'great experience. waiters/waitress were very knowkedgeable.', 'Great health protocols , best patio so far . The food was amazing', 'Appreciate that the patio is open for service. Our waitress Olivia as always was outstanding. However, we found that all three drinks we ordered were either watered down or not of the quality expected. The food was mediocre at best.', 'Went for brunch. I called ahead to make sure they could accommodate allergies as they have a limited menu due to Covid. I was told that they would be ‘very accommodating’ however when we arrived our server kept saying things couldn’t get substituted etc... therefore they were not accommodating. Luckily my cousin was okay with eating French fries as her meal but it was not ideal. I’m an avid supporter of all Drake venues and have been to the commissary several times, this was just one of those frustrating experiences.', 'Great amount of fun non-alcoholic drink options.', 'This was our first night out since Covid hit, and we were really looking forward to our first patio dining experience. We had never eaten at the commissary before, so this was also a new venue for us. I am gluten-free and was happy to see the gluten-free items clearly identified on the menu. We ordered a round of drinks and appetizers to start and ordered our mains shortly after. As a former server, I was a bit concerned that our server was not writing anything down, especially because we had asked for his recommendations and engaged him in conversation. He did not seem familiar with the menu at all and struggled to recommend a wine and his favourite dishes for us to try. Anytime we asked a question he seemed quite annoyed and began to treat us with more and more disdain as the night went on. The drinks were incredible, but the apps were mediocre at best. The dishes seemed to be using all of the same ingredients and flavours. Two of us ordered the same salad (halloumi salad) which was clearly identified as GF on the menu and requested to add chicken. We also ordered one brisket', 'During Stage-2 opening of patios reservations are recommended due to limited seating. As always cocktails, food, and service are terrific.', 'Friendly staff, accommodating, great food selection, comfortable ambiance.', 'Friendly, helpful wait staff. Delightful (and socially distant) patio. Excellent food and beverages (we had babaganoush, burgers fries, beer). Only minor issue was that the app was brought to the table at the same time as the mains - would have preferred the app earlier.', 'Nice quaint place to relax with friends. The food menu is limited considering Covid 19 as they are only allowed to serve food outside so that is understandable. I’m not usually one to look at prices while dining out but the drink prices here were pretty steep. 15 bucks+tax for a Pimms (that too served in a small collins glass) is steep by any stretch of imagination. Would probably go here again but when they are fully functional. The food was exceptional though.', 'Second time back and the service continues to be the downfall of this great spot. Understanding we all need to be patient given the circumstances, their patio is just flat out under-staffed. My husband waited 15 minutes at our table upon arrival and no one even came by with water or to take a beer order. Little things that add up like quality checks, beverage top ups, clearing of plates - none of it was happening. So much so that we wanted dessert but just asked for the bill.', 'Excellent food.', ""Delicious and safe experience! Temperature taken and a few basic health questions before being seated. Spacing is good, just right. ALSO, if you're concerned about sun, this place is all shade at supper time! Service was great and food was tasty. I had eggplant parm; it was delicious, but not hot enough. Love rapini; it is underrated, imo. Their non-alcoholic drink selection was great; strawberry lemonade was only $4; the perfect patio drink! My friends enjoyed their sangria, so much fruit! Both desserts were excellent, much bigger portions than expected! Would go back!"", 'Incredible food, service and covid precautions. We had a wonderful dinner and will definitely be returning!', 'The food was delicious and the sangria was so refreshing. Definitely try out the roasted eggplant dip!', 'Delicious meal on the patio, contactless menu option, lots of space.', 'I get that it’s difficult for restaurants to keep up the same quality level but food wasn’t very good. Fries were meh and the wings were strangely spiced. I’ve eaten there a few times when life was normal so know they can do much better even with their much smaller menu.', ""We really enjoyed their pitchers of sangria, though they aren't doing draft beer right now. We had an nice space on the patio and enjoyed getting outside!"", 'Friendly welcome , with immediate service by personable waitress. excellent food experience.

The food was delicious and the staff were really great. I always enjoy my time at Drake.', 'Attentive Service A Good Cocktail Tasty Food The room felt a bit tense due to the newness of in-restaurant dining That is not a negative towards the operator or staff, but a reality', 'Staff are to be commended for being graciously welcoming while conducting themselves in these COVID times. We felt comfortable but assured that safety precautions were being carefully followed. Food was great, as usual.', 'Even though we were sat in what is basically car park - it was great! The food was delicious and we LOVED the cocktails, the music selection we all (ages 16, 28, 34 and 60) thought was great (not too loud not too quiet). Service could have been better, not massively attentive, other than when up-selling for us to order more drinks. We ended up with no cutlery at one point and had to ask twice for more napkins - that said we still gave a generous tip to the staff for showing up and serving us during covid.

The food is good -- the appetizers were great (muscles and calamari). The muscles in marinara on both occasions were some of the best around. Saturday is also half price bottle of wine night -- unheard of for a weekend so thanks for that! The portions are huge -- too much for almost anyone to eat in one seating so plan for leftovers. The place is kind of big and seems more like a post-soccer game hangout, but it is good for a Saturday night dinner with friends too. The servers are all working hard, but there's something wrong there -- not enough of them or they are overstretched so that items come slowly and requests for more water, etc. happen regularly. Grated parm was never offered (same for coffee and dessert -- not that we had room, but it would have been nice to be asked). It's symptomatic of a pizza post-soccer place that they're under staffed.

Nach kurzer Zeit waren keine Teller mehr da, die die dann geholt wurden waren aber kochend heiss, sodaß man sie auch nicht nehmen konnte. Bereits nach 1,5 Stunden war kaum noch Nachtisch da es wurden Torten und Profiterolos geholt aber es gab keine Teller und Gabeln mehr. Beim Obst wurden nur Erdbeeren nachgefüllt. Vorlege Besteck war auch zuwenig vorhanden, sodas die Gäste sich mit einem Löffel aus verschiedenen Schüsseln bedienten. Die Tische sahen in kürzester Zeit sehr unappetitlich aus.

The view from the terrace is very nice and one can catch the evening breeze and enjoy the lakeside view. The food is more than ok.

Unserem Geburtstagskind wurde nicht gratuliert, obwohl bei der Reservierung nach dem Anlass gefragt wurde. Es war kein Kellner für uns fest zuständig. Salat war völlig unmariniert, Essig und Öl musste ich mir selbst holen. Mitarbeiter rückten sehr unvorsichtig über ein n langen Zeitraum Tisch und Stühle, dadurch entstand eine hohe Lärmbelästigung. Mitarbeiter die die Tische für abends eindeckten griffen jede Gabel an den Zacken an. Ich könnte jetzt noch viele weitere Details berichten...

I looked at the hostess and said, oh no...this will not do at all. I can’t believe there is a 4-top there. She politely said she understood and that she’d seat us somewhere else as soon as possible. So, back to the bar we went. We waited another 15 minutes or so, and then were seated at a booth. Much better. Our waiter- I wish I could remember his name- he was very blah; didn’t seem happy to be at work at all. Fortunately, the food was yummy! We were celebrating 2 birthdays at our table, and I had put a note on Open Table and the server brought two plates of baklava with candles that was much appreciated. But, he just kind of put them down, no smile, no nothing. Maybe he was having a bad night- but I hope for', 'We had the dip sampler and the crispy meatballs which were both delicious. Our friends shared the meat sampler, which was very generous in size. Both the eggplant side and the slow roasted carrots were outstanding. The whole stuffed red snapper was nicely cooked, but a bit on the sweet side for me for a savory dish. The server was excellent and very helpful with what was apparently a new menu.', 'Our waiter was super friendly. The food was delicious!', 'Excellent meal at Kleos! Brought business colleagues for a dinner and everyone was impressed with the food and service. Everyone I bring to Kleos is always happy there!', 'Gyros are always good, but the Pork Belly is amazing!

Service was disappointing for such a beautiful restaurant. Staff was not responsive in a timely manner nor did the host greet or say goodbye. We got better, friendly customer service from J.R. who was in charge of valet.', 'Kleos came up in my search when looking for somewhere new to eat and I tentatively asked my husband if he’d try Greek. We typically stay in our comfort zone. It I wanted to try something new. I couldn’t have been happier. I learned to pronounce some new words and I put trust in the chefs to make something delicious. Will, our waiter, was attentive, he suggested a great drink for me and kept our waters full. Wonderful, wonderful dinner. I’m so glad we tried something new.', 'We were headed to the theater and they were having staff issues and they more then accomadating! they went out of there way to make sure we were on time to the show and that we were able to get our food.', 'The food was delicious.

And Greek wine is the best!', ""The old Taza site is revamped and very airy and attractive. We sat near a window on a rather mild, early winter evening, and occasionally, the wind came right through. Our waitperson was very good, very amiable, and fairly prompt with requests. Of the three of us, one ordered the Greek lasagna, and was amazed at the size of the dish (or pot). I snatched a taste and agreed. My companion and I both ordered the gyro with terrific fries - large and crisp, and a small but adequate Greek salad - no lettuce, but plenty of cukes and tomatoes that actually did not taste like cardboard at this out of season time. However, the gyro was so heavy on the cumin that I had to take up the waitress' suggestion of more tzatziki to calm that overwhelming ingredient. Almost everyone there was obviously pre-show at PPAC, and staff managed to get us all out on time. I will definitely return and try another dish."", 'Sat near door and got a cold blast every time someone entered or left', 'We were there for dinner on January 30 and the restaurant was not busy- which was very nice. We are return customers because the food is outstanding and the service is excellent. The flavors are so distinct and everything is fresh. I love lamb but I am very picky about where I order it but I will always order the lamb shank here- absolutely delicious. For this dinner, my husband ordered several sides! The lemon potatoes were amazing and even better the next morning when reheated until crispy for breakfast! :) Enjoy!', 'Always a great meal!', 'Freezing cold when door opens. Meals good Dessert, overcooked', 'This Greek girl says “OUTSTANDING!” Reminds me of Yaya ‘s Greek cooking!', 'There are few Greek restaurants in or near Providence, RI so I did not know what to expect. I made an early reservation and learned if you don’t you will not get a table after 7pm. The bar is very nice as well. To my surprise the food was fabulous! HUGE portions, great selections from vegan to foodie to meat and potato fans. You will not be disappointed. The kitchen is slow but what I learned is to be patient because the meal is cooked to perfection. Go early for a leisurely dinner and take home for a delicious dinner at home.

Dandelion greens well done but too bitter for many people.', 'Mixed grill was very dry. We each tried a piece n tried the next and all was very dry.

We would like to go back, but will not accept dry lamb again.', 'Great waitress, real food, delicious quartino of retsina', 'Overall the experience was great! The food was absolutely delicious. The restaurant I felt was very warm and was a bit noisy. I had to really lean in to hear my friend speaking. We had put in appetizers and had our drinks and about 10-15 minutes later our waitress came over to apologize because our appetizers for some reason were not communicated to the kitchen. We hadn’t even noticed the time that had gone by as we were content sipping our drinks and chatting. Appetizers came shortly after. Our water glasses were always full and our main dish was amazing. To make up for the late apps our waitress presented us with a huge piece of baklava on the house! Overall a wonderful visit! Will always recommend and look forward to going back.', ""Great meal. Couldn't ask for better. Our server was pleasant and made dinner enjoyable. Helpful suggestions were appreciated."", 'Everything was delicious - seafood stew, fish, moussaka, green beans, the appetizers - the tower of crisp veggies, the plate of dips.

The staff were great - very friendly, hospitable and quick. The food is average, but one thing that really stands out is the boneless chicken wings on the appetizer menu. Get those and some fries for dinner, and you won't be sorry. I often try something different when we go there, but nothing ever beats the boneless wings! This was our first dining experience outdoors at NYAJs and to be honest the ambiance isn't great. It's right next to two fairly busy roads and the only thing helping with the traffic noise is the fact that the seating area is surrounded by a berm. It's not a deal killer, but there might be better spots for a date.

This visit was disappointing. Our waitress was not very attentive, the drinks (martinis) were small and weak.', 'Many diners are currently looking for outdoor dining opportunities. The furniture, the shade opportunites, consideration of climate considerations (fans) leaves a lot to be desired. There is no reason the entire outside dining area cannot be covered rather than a few umbrellas. The outdoor furniture was generally uncomfortable. Avery was our server and was terrific. From pizzas to sandwiches, the food was very good. Until they upgrade their outside dining I would not recommend the patio, but the food and service were quite good.', 'We were greeted by a very nice hostess and brought to our table. Our waiter was probably the most bland and impersonal waiter we’ve ever had. No emotion, monotone, and seemed as if he didn’t want to wait on our table.

Great place to enjoy a meal.', ""Our Father's Day dinner started out good with the exception of a few things. - Our server asked to approach our table which we all thought to give us our menus. He was way overly friendly to the point that he was way too close to our personal space and he continually leaned our table to talk with us. - Due to the VA rules of COVID, Face Mask we're not a priority with management. As new customers walked through the door they disregarded the mask signs posted. - Seating needed to be priority. We were seating in high traffic area which I should have said something. During our dinner a family walked in without mask and were seated approx. three feet from our booth. If restaurants want to serve guest, management needs to be more aware of all the Covid guidelines both with customers and their staff."", 'Good outdoor seating and COVID mitigation efforts. Bread and oil delivered as we sat down was fantastic. Food overall was just ok, certainly not bad, but not notably great.

Also we let them know in advance that it was my wife's birthday and not a mention of it the whole evening. Finally I had to tell the waiter so they would bring a candle on her dessert. What is the point of entering information like that on the reservation if they are not going to pay attention to it?"", 'When I made a 6:45 pm reservation I had no idea the restaurant closed at 8:00 pm.

I will continue to patronize to help keep restaurants in business, but next time I’ll probably do take-out.', 'Outstanding food and service. I was blown away by the simple Super Crunch Salad with chicken which was delicious. Chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly!!

At one point, I asked him a question, and it caused my friend to “please stop being so rude.” He never once made eye contact or apologized. His appearance was one of someone who may very well been wearing the same clothes he had on the night before.

Bravo.', 'Awesome Food and Exceptional Service. There were very few people inside - most on the patio.', ""I normally really like Not Your Average Joe's, especially the location in Rockville. However the food was not good at this location (admittedly it was a limited menu because of COVID).

As a couple presenting as one vegetarian and one non-vegetarian, we were unprepared for the paltry options afforded to plant-based dining by the ala carte menu. Unfortunately to order from any of the set-menus requires a concert of two. We attempted to make do as best we could. The edamame was agreeable, although to no standard greater than can be achieved at home. The trio of tofu came surprisingly in more of a dessert presentation –blended and sweet– and whilst the creamy texture was not unpleasant, the flavors of each were too heavy-handed to enjoy more than a mouthful of.

Overall there is no complaint except for the very salty food; though it tasted excellent The small details to make the perfect meal, I would recommend Double Rainbow ensure the wait staff better communicate with each other - we had the set menu but various members of staff kept asking us if we'd like to order any food throughout the first two courses of our meal, with the set menu there was a complimentary beer but we had to ask, and as soon as we paid and got up to leave another staff member asked if we had paid.

Memorable meals have been chicken saltinbocca, veal marsala (some of the best I've had anywhere), halibut and the seafood risotto (frutta di mare). The inside of the restaurant is clean and simple but pleasant. The outside offers a cute patio, but the traffic is really too much to enjoy a quiet relaxing dinner. Two things that could easily make this restaurant great instead of just good, is: 1) put cocktails in proper glasses. Martinis are offered in small stemless glasses that offer nothing special when a martini is a special cocktail deserving of a little special treatment. My guest was served a cocktail typically served in a double rocks glass in a tiny low-ball glass which meant frequent refills and low value. 2) the owner's personality is very off-putting and unpleasant.

My guests had seafood risotto, veal Marsala and Chicken Saltimbocca. Caesar salad is outstanding and worth the upgrade from their house salad, although house dressing is excellent.

Das Personal war sehr freundlich aber leider nicht sehr Aumerksam. (vllt lag es an der große Tafel neben uns die scheinbar VIP status hatten) Es war auch nicht so schlimm. geht aber besser... Der einizge richtige Laspus: Die 2 Espressi zum Dessert haben wir bekommen aber das Dessert leider nicht. Das haben wir nach 30min abbestellt weil wir unseren Babysitter nicht länger warten lassen konnten. Der Chef hat sich sofort vielmals entschuldigt und freundlicherweise angeboten uns das Dessert noch kostenlos zu servieren, aber dafür fehlte uns dann leider die Zeit und wir mussten leider ablehnen. Wir kommen bestimmt mal wieder.', 'Wie immer super: perfekter Service, bestes Essen, uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen.', 'Traumhaftes Ambiente mit exzellentem Essen! Der service ist aufmerksam und freundlich! Unbedingt empfehlenswert!', 'Das Essen war Erstklassig. Der Service hat trotz der grossen Hitze perfekt funktioniert. Hier ist jeder Abend ein besonderes Erlebnis.', 'Wie gut war das denn? In Corona wird man demütig, keine Tischdecken im Sterne Restaurant, Desinfektionsmittel wie auf der Intensivstation. Zum Genuss gehört halt das Ambiente und das ist meistens weg. Hier nicht! Ein unglaublich aufmerksamer Service, hervorragende Empfehlungen, eine Entspanntheit, die ihresgleichen sucht. Die Illusion eines Restaurantbesuchs in Frankreich ist (fast) perfekt, das Erleben eines genussvollen, unbeschwerten Abends aber ganz real. Danke, Petit Bonheur, wir kommen wieder!', 'Wir hatten viel Spaß und werden bald wieder kommen. Super nettes Restaurant und spitzen Service!!!!!', 'Hervorragendes Essen, aufmerksamer perfekter Service. Wir gehen regelmäßig hin und sind immer wieder begeistert', 'Wir haben das 4-Gang Menü gegessen. Die Vorspeise sowie der Fleisch- und Fischgang waren geschmacklich sehr ausgewogen und mit hochwertigen Produkten zubereitet. Leider war das Dessert (weisse Schokolade mit Pflaume) dagegen zu süß und zu kompakt – möglicherweise, weil es bereits seit längerem auf der Kühlung stand. Dadurch wurde der sehr gute Gesamt-Eindruck des Menus zu Schluß deutlich geschmälert. Schade.', 'Leider wurden wir vom Service ein wenig stiefmütterlich behandelt. Mit ein wenig mehr Aufmerksamkeit hätten wir sicherlich noch eine weiter Flasche Wein getrunken. Das Ambiente und das Essen waren sehr gut.', 'Alles sehr persönlich und auf höchstem Niveau.', 'Dinner for 4 - Not sure what went wrong ... We were seated, and we ordered an aperitif and two bottles of water. A bit later I asked if we could see the menu we were going to be served, but was told that this was not possible. I politely said that it would be nice to know so that we could chose wine for dinner, but was told that there was no wine menu ?? We got the first dish before we finally got the wine list, and before someone told us what the remaining 4 dishes were going to be. Finally a very sweet waiter gave us a bit of attention and we got our wine as well. We made sure to order the second bottle well in advance. In all we were thankfully in a good mood so nothing could really get us down, but the whole experience was a disappointment, and I was a bit embarrassed towards my guests. We arrived at 1915 and were only done by 2315. Perhaps they were short staffed that day, perhaps this or that, but I am happy that it was Groupon deal, as I would certainly not have liked', 'Wir waren zum zweiten mal dort, wurden sehr nett begrüßt und erneut nicht enttäuscht.

So behandelt man Stammgäste. Aufmerksamer Service, warme Beleuchtung, lebhaftes Publikum, gleichwohl konnten wir uns leise unterhalten. Dass sämtliche Speisen auf den Punkt waren, versteht sich von selbst, die Saucen sind ein französischer Traum! Ohne wenn & aber mein neuer Lieblingsladen. À bientôt!', 'Sehr gutes Essen und nette Bedienung. Teilweise hat es etwas lange gedauert, aber das Ambiente hat es wett gemacht. :)', ""Very bad service! We had 4 course menu and it took hours between them as the waiter was far too behind standard.

We waited for some time with no service; finally flagged a waiter and asked if they were going to serve us. He said they were all out of menus so I asked if we could at least have some drinks while we waited. We were served drinks and finally got some menus. There was a huge display board at the front of the restauarant that said “all day eggs benedict.” My husband ordered the eggs bendict and was told they weren’t able to do it because the kitchen was too busy. We ordered the burger special and it was delicious. We had to ask our waiter for water, and for our bills when the meal was done. Food was great; service was lacking.', 'Amazing food and our server was so friendly and layed back. She didn’t make us feel rushed or like she had otherthings to do.

Thank you so much!', ""My wife and I went to Claudine's for St-Valentine dinner. This was our first visit in their new location. We loved the decor. Limited menu but still a number of excellent choices. My wife said that her filet mignon was the best she had in 15 years. I loves the full bellied clams, but regretted that they are not serving home cut fries (which I loved at their previous location). The staff was very nice, our service was outstanding. The hostess and the waitress checked to see that we had everything and the food was good. Claudine did the same. All together, a very good experience, good meal at a good cost."", ""Very nice food, well presented, cooked and good portions. I found a hair in my fish tacos - and told the server, but also told the server not to worry about it, however - usually they take the foreign object to the kitchen to show the chef and something is comped on the bill. No soup or beer was comped, I was surprised. I'm pretty flexible too - it happens, but hoped for some acknowledgement from the kitchen or management."", 'Loved it! Will be back. Planning our work holiday party there!', 'The food and service is AMAZING. You can tell they really try to give you the best quality possible and it is nice to feel like you are really paying for what you get and the quality of it.

The staff is very kind and they check up on you (which i like) to make sure that everything is okay and that you are having a great time.', ""Food was really good. My wife and I were in to have a nice quiet dinner for our anniversary and the atmosphere was great for that. Restaurant closed at 8, we arrived around 6:45. I felt like after our food was served that the server was trying to rush us as I believe we were the only ones in the restaurant at that point. There was a few people there when we first arrived. He tried to take my plate and I wasn't finished. I like having servers check on us to see how the food was tasting or to see if we needed anything but this was overkill. We were asked way too many times so in the end I just felt like they were rushing us so they could be quicker to close. This wasn't our first visit to the restaurant, our other experience was great with the food and the service. I would still recommend this place but may not want to go back within an hour of closing if the same servers are working."", 'A very pleasant atmosphere, friendly and clean. I had the Lobster roll which was full of lovely fresh meat. My one recommendation would be that the dill be eliminated from it.', ""I went to Claudine's Eatery with my son and daughter-in-law during my visit from BC.

We felt comfortable and made to be welcome and treated special by her for the whole evening. I had the seafood linguine with a beautiful glass of Pondview Riesling while my husband ordered the stuffed Cornish hen with a choice red wine he loved.

The restaurant was lit with flickering candles which had a very calming effect. We were seated in the spacious new addition over looking the water. Our server, Louis, was very friendly and knowledge about the food and the area. We started with the baked Brie appetizer. It arrived warm and gooey with plenty of dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds and a stack of crunchy crostini. Plenty to share with 2-3 people. I had the lamb shank. The meat was so tender it fell off the bone. My dining partner had the steak which was cooked to a proper medium rare. Both meals were very filling. To end the night we shared the cream brulee trio and their flourless chocolate torte. Each cream brulee had a perfect sugar crust which cracked to reveal a different delicious cream center and the torte was a slow decadent death by chocolate. I have dined in Muskoka over the past 18 years and this is one of the best dining experiences I have enjoyed.', 'WE spent a very pleasant evening on the patio. The food was excellent and service attentive. And the setting is supurb.', 'Service and ambience were great - as expected. But the $20 hamburg was really disappointing.

We literally had to grab someone passing by the table to get drinks & food. We gave up on my husband's order of a dessert coffee & just got a check.

We go here once a year for either one of our birthdays &/or Valentines Day. And usually get the beef stroganoff. The stroganoff wasn’t quite up to the usual excellence this time. The beef was over cooked and not a lot of flavor. But I am comparing it to their usual amazing dish! Anywhere else it would have been considered still very good.

Just wish ingredients list is detailed in front of each dish to assist with food restrictions. Had asked if lamb stew was spicy or had any chili. The answer was no but when one of my guest had a slight reaction, found out that when I asked again for detailed list of spices, another student said small amount cayenne pepper was used.

Noise level too loud. Students are all very personable and clearly trying hard to please but need more supervision from manager to be mindful as to what crosses the line from being attentive to being intrusive. More communication needed amongst servers to coordinate service with tables/customers.

Food was creatively plated. Inspired use of local and seasonal ingredients. Great value. Grilled rack of lamb was cooked to perfection as was the seared sea bream. Gnocchi was a bit doughy.

Good value for money.', 'I feel $15 would be a better price point. It is a restaurant where kids are learning and is a part of their education. Coffee should be included to to practice a full A to Z experience. I would go back, but $15 should be the price for dinner and $10 for lunch. I would appreciate more variety.

Thank for helping make our evening that much more special.', 'I booked A table for lunch on Easter Sunday. It turned out to be a price fixed partial buffet which wasn’t mentioned when I booked. They tried to seat us right near the buffet which would have been very unpleasant. We were then, not very nicely given another table, very small and very uncomfortable wooden chairs next to a family with very unruly children, many children I might say.

I had the wild salmon, which was overcooked and dry with no seasonings.

The first time (Thanksgiving), I let this slide. This past Sunday (Mothers\' Day), however, I said something to the hostess. She was very unapologetic, saying that the Mayflower is presently \\""down a Reservationist...[such that] there have been many kinks.\\"" She told me that I should have known that my 10:00 a.m. seating time would be in the the Tap Room (how, I am not sure, as I spoke directly with someone at the Mayflower to confirm my 10:00 a.m. Mothers\' Day brunch reservation IN THE DINING ROOM), because \\""Holiday brunches do not begin seating until 11:00.\\"" For many years, every person at the Mayflower could be relied upon to provide unparalleled levels of service.

When I made the reservation for myself and 2 friends, we were super excited to eat at this restaurant. We were in town from NYC, and we've all been to Chumley's and Gotham Bar and Grill before and were excited to again try Chef Victoria Blamey's food. We had looked at the menu, and had multiple things in mind to try however when we sat down we were give a QR code menu that was pre-fix, extremely limited in selection and extraordinarily expensive for what it was. I'm allergic to shellfish, so that limited the already limited selection that was presented on the menu but all in all, for 3 courses, it's hard to justify $130 before drinks, tax, and tip when one item was a green salad with vinaigrette. All in all the food was average, but i think my biggest disappointment was the lack of awareness as a customer that the menu was going to be pre-fix prior to my dining there.

Beautiful grounds to walk around.', 'Elegant setting, outstanding cuisine, fine wine list. Service, while professional, could be a little more organized. Our primary server was supported by various others which at times resulted in having to ask for the primary server to come to our table. At other times we were asked the same question by multiple support servers. Feeling that you need to manage the service personally is not something one should expect at a very high end restaurant.', 'We went to dinner, expecting a great meal. I ordered the tasting menu, and my husband ordered a la carte. We were not thrilled with the food. It’s as though the new chef is trying to make each dish so fancy that they lose focus of what has been ordered. For example, my husband’s foie gras was surrounded by barely ripe figs and sauce with just a tiny piece of foie. His agnolotti entree order was tiny. My scallop Crudo had so much garnish and spices that I could not taste the fresh scallop (yes, just one) at all. No longer worth the cost.', 'This is a refined and nice place for a friendly dinner. The room is quiet enough for conversation, the ambiance is very pleasant and the staff was friendly, efficient and not overpowering. Three of us had a duck appetizer which was outstanding and one person had a beet salad which was very nice. For entrees three of us had a lobster risotto and one had rack of lamb. The rack of lamb was nicely done and well presented. The lobster risotto consisted of the body and tail of a lobster out of the shell on top of the risotto. Unfortunately the risotto was basically tasteless and could not be recommended. They are trying hard and the place is much improved from what it was under former ownership. At this price level there is nearby competition to which they do not quite measure up. Perhaps we will try again and see if a different entree will allow us to upgrade our review.', 'I hesitated writing this review because the Manager graciously comped our dinner after being informed of the issues we experienced but I feel compelled to do so. We arrived at the Inn and were seated promptly. We were approached by two separate waiters and asked what type of water we would like. We informed the first that we wanted sparkling water with limes. We told the second waiter we had already ordered water. The water arrived without the limes. We then were approached by two different waiters asking if we would like any drinks. We ordered from the first waiter and told the second waiter we had already ordered. The menu, a fixed menu at $130 for three courses plus drinks and gratuities, was limited but we found appetizers and entrees that were acceptable. Before receiving our appetizers a waiter, not ours, came to our tables with two entrees; not ours. He wandered off looking for which table the entrees were for.

It’s was over 40 minutes between our starter and entree. I asked where our food was twice and the second time was told it was being plated. Ten minutes later the food showed up and my rack of lamb appeared grayish in color and was very tough and rubbery on the outside and rare in the center. Clearly something went wrong and I expressed my disappointment with the meal and did not eat it. The waiter had no explanation for what happened to our food and was not concerned with our dissatisfaction or offered to substitute something else. When one is paying what they charge for the portions they serve, the service and quality should match the prices.', ""I was very happy with our choice to celebrate my 50th brithday at the Mayflower Inn. We sat outside on the deck overlooking the gardens. A really very special setting. It was a gorgeous evening. The service was impeccable and friendly. The food was delicious. Of course, it is expensive and portions are not huge, but as you expect for fine dining experience and it was plenty for us. It was SO beautiful and serene that I don't want to save visits for only special occasions and will plan on coming by more often to have drinks and appetizers on deck, in the cozy bar or on the side veranda.

I had a delicious sunchoke soup and a very fine quail dish. Both were extremely flavorful.', 'Everything about this experience was incredible. The setting, staff, service and food was a delight.', 'In two words, our dining experience was VERY DISAPPOINTING. While the initial level of service was appropriate for a high level restaurant, service rapidly declined after our appetizers were served. Our entrees arrived but the mushroom side ordered to accompany our main courses did not. When I pointed this out I was told that the side would be coming; it did, after we completed eating our entrees. I sent the mushrooms back. When the entrees arrived we asked for a glass of wine for my wife and a Martini for me. My wife’s wine arrived; my Martini did not. After waiting a considerable period of time, I advised one of the four service people involved in our dinner to cancel the Martini. (This was very much a “Who’s on first” scenario.) We were then asked by another server if we would like coffee or desert. Based on our poor experience to that point, I declined both and asked for our check. Another server came to our table while we were waiting for our check stating that the Martini was prepared and asked if I would like it delivered to our room.

The clientele for Sunday lunch seemed to be regular and a much older generation, so felt slightly uncomfortable with our young children even though they were very well behaved. I booked this for my Husbands birthday and mentioned this on the booking, unfortunately this was not acknowledged at all in the restaurant which was a bit of a shame. Then children loved their meals, but unfortunately their drinks remained on the bill even though it stated on the menu free if two courses were ordered for children. We didn't want to query this at the time as we didn't want to ruin the occasion. Lovely food and lovely staff!!"", 'Had afternoon tea which was fantastic and really filling, with a good variation of savoury & sweet things. Great service & ambience on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Highly recommend!', 'Fantastic food and brilliant service, all staff were exceptionally friendly.', 'My Auntie & Uncle got married at the Mansion 40years ago & were due to celebrate at the garden restaurant in May. Unfortunately my uncle was very poorly & so they had to cancel. He has since passed away so we wanted to take my Auntie for food & so we could celebrate his life & tell her the news that we are expecting a baby. It was a perfect afternoon, the food was lovely & it brings back so many memories for all of us it wil be a place we visit over & over again. We finished off the afternoon with a stroll around the lake, the perfect Afternoon :-)', 'Booking with open table was a big mistake as the Garden Room never received our booking!!!! We arrived there on the pre booked time to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary only to find that open table had failed to pass on our reservation!!! It was only due to the professionalism of the staff that they managed to squeeze us in. Will never use open table again but will definitely return to the Garden room by booking directly with them.', 'I was under the impression this was a restaurant so booked it for valentines however it was a park cafe so was a little underwhelmed', 'A good experience and place for a family meal. Very enjoyable and great location.', 'We took some friends for lunch on a Saturday. We had pre-booked although there were a few empty tables. The service was excellent. I ordered Moules and within minutes the waiter advised that the chef was not happy with his Moules and would prefer not to serve them. I was disappointed but was impressed by the service. Slightly pricey but it would not stop from returning for another good experience overall. Great views of Roundhay Park to match the excellence of this dining experience.', ""This was our first visit to The Garden Room and we met for Sunday lunch for my daughter's birthday. We had a table in the window looking over Roundhay Park, which was lovely as we were able to enjoy all the beautiful autumnal colours. Although it wasn't a sunny day, there were plenty of people sitting outside. All our meals were beautifully presented and delicious and the Prosecco was the best I have had anywhere. All the staff were friendly and helpful; the level of service was exactly right. Overall our experience was excellent and I would be only too happy to dine here again. I hope to try the Afternoon Tea sometime soon."", ""Arranged a friends' get together with all our kids; was thoroughly enjoyable. Staff accommodated all our requests (space for 3 prams, a high chair, 9 adults and 2 toddlers, alongside 3 babies!), and service was great. Would definitely go back and highly recommend!"", ""There's no doubt the food was fantastic. A wonderful yummy Sunday roast with all the trimmings including grilled cauliflower cheese. Great quality ingredients, beautifully presented with a giant Yorkshire pudding to boot. Plus there is the added bonus of the beautiful setting in the heart of Roundhay Park. Problems on the day was the standard of service. Yes they were friendly and apologised but it was quite slow due to their 'overbooking' and large groups bookings plus they kept mishearing our requests and/or not fulfilling them.""]",20

Drinks were not great. Food was very good', 'I loved it here. It was a very friendly environment', 'Every time I go to Chicago, I make it a point to stop at Happy Camper but was disappointed this time. I was told by staff that patio was first come first serve basis. When we arrived for our reservation time, I asked if we could sit outside. The hostess told me that those tables were reserved for those that requested patio in the OpenTable notes. Nowhere in the reservation booking is this mentioned, and she did not care to be accommodating nor apologize when I mentioned that another employee told me otherwise. Once we sat down, it took another 15 minutes before a server came to our table. The food is consistently good, but service is something to be desired. We did not see our server for about 35 minutes toward the end of our reservation, until she came over to kick us out as our 2 hour limit was up. I have had consistently better experiences at Homeslice and will continue to go there.', 'great food, great drinks, great staff, great vibe! also, plenty of covid-19 precautions which made us feel safe & comfortable while dining', 'The bouncer or door man needs an attitude adjustment.

We couldn't hear the people at our table because the music was too loud. Our server wasn't attentive at all.

We shared the bread & butter and the braised beef sausage roll all delicious except we felt the smoked tomato ketchup overpowered the sausage roll. My husband and daughter had the steak cooked how they ordered it and very tender, the sides of mac'n'cheese and cauliflower cheese were good also. I had steak and onion pie which was supposed to have roasted root veg in but all I could see were carrots so that was a bit disappointing. The gravy wasn't thick enough but the flavour was good. The menu said it was served with a side of greens which to me are leafy veg such as spinach, kale, cabbage etc. but I was served green beans which I hate. Just a few small issues in what was overall a very good meal."", 'We had a lovely evening. The food and wine were excellent as was the service.

I had to ask for the bread included and the server replied oh I will check if it comes with it. The menu already states it does. When the bread eventually came it was cold and rock hard.
